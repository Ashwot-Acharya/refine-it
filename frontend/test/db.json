Define the representation function associated to the form $\\varphi$ and the sets  \\mca\\ and $B$  as follows: $$ R^{(\\varphi)}_{\\mathcal{A},B}(n) = \\text{card}\\left( \\left\\{ (a_1,\\ldots, a_h,b) \\in A_1 \\times \\cdots \\times A_h \\times B: \\varphi(a_1, \\ldots , a_h,b ) = n \\right\\} \\right).$$ If this representation function is constant, then the set $B$ is periodic and the period of $B$ will be bounded in terms of the diameter of the finite set $\\{ \\varphi(a_1,\\ldots,a_h,0): (a_1,\\ldots, a_h) \\in A_1 \\times \\cdots \\times A_h\\}.$",

        "Abstract": "We report the discovery of 40 new globular clusters (GCs) that have been found in surveys of the halo of M31 based on INT/WFC and CHFT/Megacam imagery. A subset of these these new GCs are of an extended, diffuse nature, and include those already found in Huxor et al. (2005). The search strategy is described and basic positional and V and I photometric data are presented for each cluster. For a subset of these clusters, K-band photometry is also given. The new clusters continue to be found to the limit of the survey area (~100 kpc), revealing that the GC system of M31 is much more extended than previously realised. The new clusters increase the total number of confirmed GCs in M31 by approximately 10% and the number of confirmed GCs beyond 1 degree (~14 kpc) by more than 75%. We have also used the survey imagery as well recent HST archival data to update the Revised Bologna Catalogue (RBC) of M31 globular clusters.",

        "Title": "Small Dwarf Galaxies Within Larger Dwarfs: Why Some Are Luminous While Most Go Dark",
        "Authors": "Elena D'Onghia(1),George Lake(1) ((1) University of Zurich)",
        "Abstract": "We consider the possibility that the Magellanic Clouds were the largest members of a group of dwarf galaxies that entered the Milky Way (MW) halo at late times. Seven of the eleven brightest satellites of the MW may have been part of this system. The proximity of some dwarfs to the plane of the orbit of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has been used to argue that they formed from tidal debris from the LMC and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Instead, they may owe to the tidal breakup of the Magellanic Group. This can explain the association of many of the dwarf galaxies in the Local Group with the LMC system. It provides a mechanism for lighting up dwarf galaxies and reproduces the bright end of the cumulative circular velocity distribution of the satellites in the MW without invoking a stripping scenario for the subhalos to match the satellite distribution expected according to CDM theory. Finally, our model predicts that other isolated dwarfs will be found to have companions. Evidence for this prediction is provided by nearby, recently discovered dwarf associations.",

        "Abstract": "We identify a third image in the unique quasar lens SDSS J1029+2623, the second known quasar lens produced by a massive cluster of galaxies. The spectrum of the third image shows similar emission and absorption features, but has a redder continuum than the other two images which can be explained by differential extinction or microlensing. We also identify several lensed arcs. Our observations suggest a complicated structure of the lens cluster at z~0.6. We argue that the three lensed images are produced by a naked cusp on the basis of successful mass models, the distribution of cluster member galaxies, and the shapes and locations of the lensed arcs. Lensing by a naked cusp is quite rare among galaxy-scale lenses but is predicted to be common among large-separation lensed quasars. Thus the discovery can be viewed as support for an important theoretical prediction of the standard cold dark matter model.",

        "Authors": "R.H.K. Kadala,P.G. Mercadante,J.K. Mizukoshi,Xerxes Tata",
        "Abstract": "The branching fraction for the decays of gluinos to third generation quarks is expected to be enhanced in classes of supersymmetric models where either third generation squarks are lighter than other squarks, or in mixed-higgsino dark matter models constructed to be in concordance with the measured density of cold dark matter. In such scenarios, gluino production events at the CERN Large Hadron Collider should be rich in top and bottom quark jets. Requiring b-jets in addition to missing transverse energy should, therefore, enhance the supersymmetry signal relative to Standard Model backgrounds from V + jet, VV and QCD backgrounds (V=W, Z). We quantify the increase in the supersymmetry reach of the LHC from b-tagging in a variety of well-motivated models of supersymmetry. We also explore ``top-tagging'' at the LHC. We find that while the efficiency for this turns out to be too low to give an increase in reach beyond that obtained via b-tagging, top-tagging can indeed provide a confirmatory signal if gluinos are not too heavy. Finally, we explore the prospects for detecting the direct production of third generation squarks in models with an inverted squark mass hierarchy. This is signalled by b-jets + missing transverse energy events harder than in the Standard Model, but softer than those from the production of gluinos and heavier squarks. We find that while these events can be readily separated from SM background (for third generation squark masses ~300-500 GeV), the contamination from the much heavier gluinos and squarks remains formidable if these are also accessible.",

        "Title": "Dark matter dynamics in Galactic center",
        "Authors": "Eugene Vasiliev,Maxim Zelnikov",
        "Abstract": "The evolution of dark matter in central areas of galaxies is considered (the Milky Way is taken as an example). It is driven by scattering off of dark matter particles by bulge stars, their absorption by the supermassive black hole and self-annihilation. This process is described by diffusion equation in the phase space of energy and angular momentum. The equation was integrated for several different models of initial dark matter distribution and using various assumptions about the dynamical factors. It turns out that because the Milky Way center is rather dynamically old (~5 relaxation times t_r), the difference in initial conditions almost vanishes. The density attains a nearly universal profile, and the gamma-ray flux from dark matter annihilation lies in rather narrow range, which enables more robust determination of the dark matter parameters. By present time the mass of dark matter inside the black hole sphere of influence (r<2 pc) has been reduced approximately twice, mostly because of heating by stars. It is shown that the dynamics of dark matter for t>t_r is determined mainly by stars outside the sphere of influence.",

        "Title": "2D skew scattering in the vicinity and away from resonant scattering condition",
        "Authors": "V. V. Mkhitaryan,M. E. Raikh",
        "Abstract": "We studied the energy dependence of the 2D skew scattering from strong potential, for which the Born approximation is not applicable. Since the skew scattering cross section is zero both at low and at high energies, it exhibits a maximum as a function of energy of incident electron. We found analytically the shape of the maximum for an exactly solvable model of circular-barrier potential. Within a rescaling factor, this shape is universal for strong potentials. If the repulsive potential has an attractive core, the discrete levels of the core become quasilocal due to degeneracy with continuum. For energy of incident electron close to the quasilocal state with zero angular momentum, the enhancement of the net cross section is accompanied by resonant enhancement of the skew scattering. By contrast, near the resonance with quasilocal states having momenta $\\pm 1$, the skew scattering cross section is an odd function of energy deviation from the resonance, and passes through zero, i.e., it exhibits a sign reversal. In the latter case, in the presence of the Fermi sea, the Kondo resonance manifests itself in strong temperature dependence of the skew scattering.",

        "Abstract": "Superconductivity above 25K, and possibly above 40K, has recently been discovered in $LaO_{1-x}F_xFeAs$ and related compounds. We propose that this is another example of the mechanism of hole superconductivity at play. This requires the existence of hole carriers at the Fermi energy, which appears to contradict current observations. We propose that two-band conduction is taking place in these materials, that the negative ion $As^{-3}$ plays a key role, and that superconductivity is non-phononic and driven by pairing and undressing of heavily dressed hole carriers to lower their kinetic energy. We make several predictions of future observations based on our theory.",

        "Authors": "Anudeep Kanwar,Luc Simard,David Schade,Stephen D. J. Gwyn",
        "Abstract": "The formation and growth of galaxy disks over cosmic time is crucial to our understanding of galaxy formation. Despite steady improvements in the size and quality of disk samples over the last decade, many aspects of galaxy disk evolution remain unclear. Using two square degrees of deep, wide-field i'-band imaging from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, we compute size functions for 6000 disks from z=0.2 to z=1 and explore luminosity and number density evolution scenarios with an emphasis on the importance of selection effects on the interpretation of the data. We also compute the size function of a very large sample of disks from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to use as a local (z ~ 0.1) comparison. CFHTLS size functions computed with the same fixed luminosity-size selection window at all redshifts exhibit evolution that appears to be best modelled by a pure number density evolution. The z = 0.3 size function is an excellent match to the z = 0.9 one if disks at the highest redshift are a factor of 2.5 more abundant than in the local universe. The SDSS size function would also match the z = 0.9 CFHTLS size function very well with a similar change in number density. On the other hand, the CFHTLS size functions computed with a varying luminosity-size selection window with redshift remain constant if the selection window is shifted by 1.0$-$1.5 mag towards fainter magnitudes with decreasing redshift. There is a weak dependence on disk scale length with smaller ($h \\lesssim $ 4 kpc) disks requiring more luminosity evolution than larger ones. Given that changes in number density are primarily due to mergers and that current estimates of merger rates below z = 1 are low, luminosity evolution appears to be a more plausible scenario to explain the observations.",

        "Authors": "Frank C. van den Bosch,Anna Pasquali,Xiaohu Yang,H.J. Mo,Simone Weinmann,Daniel H. McIntosh,Daniel Aquino",
        "Abstract": "Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxy group catalogue of Yang et al. (2007), we study the average colour and average concentration of satellite galaxies as function of (i) their stellar mass, (ii) their group mass, and (iii) their group-centric radius. We find that the colours and concentrations of satellite galaxies are (almost) completely determined by their stellar mass. In particular, at fixed stellar mass, the average colours and concentrations of satellite galaxies are independent of either halo mass or halo-centric radius. We find clear evidence for mass segregation of satellite galaxies in haloes of all masses, and argue that this explains why satellites at smaller halo-centric radii are somewhat redder and somewhat more concentrated. In addition, the weak colour and concentration dependence of satellite galaxies on halo mass is simply a reflection of the fact that more massive haloes host, on average, more massive satellites. Combining these results with the fact that satellite galaxies are, on average, redder and somewhat more concentrated than central galaxies of the same stellar mass, the following picture emerges: galaxies become redder and somewhat more concentrated once they fall into a bigger halo (i.e., once they become a satellite galaxy). This is a clear manifestation of environment dependence. However, there is no indication that the magnitude of the transformation (or its timescale) depends on environment; a galaxy undergoes a transition when it becomes a satellite, but it does not matter whether it becomes a satellite of a small (Milky Way sized) halo, or of a massive cluster. We discuss the implication of this `dearth' of environment dependence for the physical processes responsible for transforming satellite galaxies.",

        "Authors": "Tudor Dan Dimofte",
        "Abstract": "We study models of stabilization near large complex structure in type IIB O3/O7 flux compactifications. We consider a special family of examples with a single nonvanishing Yukawa coupling in the large complex structure limit, which allows us to study all possible stable vacua of the tree-level no-scale potential very explicitly. We find that, by tuning fluxes, both supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric vacua can be realized at almost any point in the large complex structure moduli space of one-, two-, and three-parameter models. We also consider the effects of stringy corrections on tree-level vacua. We argue quite generally that, in certain regimes, both supersymmetric and nonsupersymmetric tree-level vacua could serve as consistent, controllable foundations for full stabilization beyond tree level (including Kahler moduli), leading to either AdS or dS cosmological constants. We show how to achieve these regimes in our models. Finally, we discuss some implications of minimizing at tree level the no-scale form of the scalar potential, versus other potentials used in statistical studies.",

We determine the structure of the renormalization group to all orders in a 1/N_f expansion, where N_f is the number of fermion spin components. Asymptotically exact results are obtained for the quantum critical theory in which, as in the large N_f theory, the nematic order has a large anomalous dimension, and the fermion spectral functions are highly anisotropic.",

        "Abstract": "Current models of galaxy formation predict satellite galaxies in groups and clusters that are redder than observed. We investigate the effect on the colours of satellite galaxies produced by the ram pressure stripping of their hot gaseous atmospheres as the satellites orbit within their parent halo. We incorporate a model of the stripping process based on detailed hydrodynamic simulations within the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. The simulations show that the environment in groups and clusters is less aggressive than previously assumed. The main uncertainty in the model is the treatment of gas expelled by supernovae. With reasonable assumptions for the stripping of this material, we find that satellite galaxies are able to retain a significant fraction of their hot gas for several Gigayears, thereby replenishing their reservoirs of cold, star forming gas and remaining blue for a relatively long period of time. A bimodal distribution of galaxy colours, similar to that observed in SDSS data, is established and the colours of the satellite galaxies are in good agreement with the data. In addition, our model naturally accounts for the observed dependence of satellite colours on environment, from small groups to high mass clusters.",

While star clusters provide important calibration samples for stellar colors, the regions close to globular clusters, where the fraction of field stars is smallest, are too crowded for the standard SDSS photometric pipeline to process. To complement the SDSS imaging survey, we reduce the SDSS imaging data for crowded cluster fields using the DAOPHOT/ALLFRAME suite of programs and present photometry for 17 globular clusters and 3 open clusters in a SDSS value-added catalog. Our photometry and cluster fiducial sequences are on the native SDSS 2.5-meter ugriz photometric system, and the fiducial sequences can be directly applied to the SDSS photometry without relying upon any transformations. Model photometry for red giant branch and main-sequence stars obtained by Girardi et al. cannot be matched simultaneously to fiducial sequences; their colors differ by ~0.02-0.05 mag. Good agreement (< ~0.02 mag in colors) is found with Clem et al. empirical fiducial sequences in u'g'r'i'z' when using the transformation equations in Tucker et al.",

        "Authors": "Molly E.C. Swanson",
        "Abstract": "Particles have tremendous potential as astronomical messengers, and conversely, studying the universe as a whole also teaches us about particle physics. This thesis encompasses both of these research directions.Many models predict a diffuse flux of high energy neutrinos from active galactic nuclei and other astrophysical sources. The \"Astrophysics Underground\" portion of this thesis describes a search for this neutrino flux performed by looking for very high energy upward-going muons using the Super-K detector.In addition to using particles to do astronomy, we can also use the universe itself as a particle physics lab. The \"Particle Physics in the Sky\" portion of this thesis focuses on extracting cosmological information from galaxy surveys.To overcome technical challenges faced by the latest galaxy surveys, we produced a comprehensive upgrade to mangle, a software package that processes the angular masks defining the survey area on the sky. We added dramatically faster algorithms and new useful features that are necessary for managing complex masks of current and next-generation galaxy surveys.With this software in hand, we utilized SDSS data to investigate the relation between galaxies and dark matter by studying relative bias, i.e., the relation between different types of galaxies. Separating galaxies by their luminosities and colors reveals a complicated picture: red galaxies are clustered more strongly than blue galaxies, with both the brightest and the faintest red galaxies showing the strongest clustering. Furthermore, red and blue galaxies tend to occupy different regions of space. In order to make precise measurements from the next generation of galaxy surveys, it will be essential to account for this complexity.",

        "Abstract": "[Abridged] We present an 8.5-hour simultaneous radio, X-ray, UV, and optical observation of the L dwarf binary 2MASSW J0746+20. We detect strong radio emission, dominated by short-duration periodic pulses at 4.86 GHz with P=124.32+/-0.11 min. The stability of the pulse profiles and arrival times demonstrates that they are due to the rotational modulation of a B~1.7 kG magnetic field. A quiescent non-variable component is also detected, likely due to emission from a uniform large-scale field. The H-alpha emission exhibits identical periodicity, but unlike the radio pulses it varies sinusoidally and is offset by exactly 1/4 of a phase. The sinusoidal variations require chromospheric emission from a large-scale field structure, with the radio pulses likely emanating from the magnetic poles. While both light curves can be explained by a rotating mis-aligned magnetic field, the 1/4 phase lag rules out a symmetric dipole topology since it would result in a phase lag of 1/2 (poloidal field) or zero (toroidal field). We therefore conclude that either (i) the field is dominated by a quadrupole configuration, which can naturally explain the 1/4 phase lag; or (ii) the H-alpha and/or radio emission regions are not trivially aligned with the field. Regardless of the field topology, we use the measured period along with the known rotation velocity (vsini=27 km/s), and the binary orbital inclination (i=142 deg), to derive a radius for the primary star of 0.078+/-0.010 R_sun. This is the first measurement of the radius of an L dwarf, and along with a mass of 0.085+/-0.010 M_sun it provides a constraint on the mass-radius relation below 0.1 M_sun. We find that the radius is about 30% smaller than expected from theoretical models, even for an age of a few Gyr.",

        "Abstract": "We study the physics on the paramagnetic side of the phase diagram of the cobaltates, $Na_{x}CoO_{2}$, with an implementation of cellular dynamical mean field theory (CDMFT) with the non-crossing approximation (NCA) for the one-band Hubbard model on a triangular lattice. At low doping we find that the low energy physics is dominated by a quasi-dispersionless band. At half-filling, we find a metal-insulator transition at $U_{c}=5.6\\pm0.15t$ which depends weakly on the cluster size. The onset of the metallic state occurs through the growth of a coherence peak at the chemical potential. Away from half filling, in the electron-doped regime, the system is metallic with a large, continuous Fermi surface as seen experimentally. Upon hole doping, a quasi non-dispersing band emerges at the top of the lower Hubbard band and controls the low-energy physics. This band is a clear signature of non-Fermi liquid behavior and cannot be captured by any weakly coupled approach. This quasi non-dispersive band, which persists in a certain range of dopings, has been observed experimentally. We also investigate the pseudogap phenomenon in the context of a triangular lattice and we propose a new framework for discussing the pseudogap phenomena in general. This framework involves a momentum-dependent characterization of the low-energy physics and links the appearance of the pseudogap to a reconstruction of the Fermi surface without invoking any long range order or symmetry breaking. Within this framework we predict the existence of a pseudogap for the two dimensional Hubbard model on a triangular lattice in the weakly hole-doped regime.",

        "Abstract": "The nonequilibrium time-dependent fluctuations of charge current have recently emerged as a sensitive experimental tool to probe ballistic transport through evanescent wave functions introduced into clean wide and short graphene strips by the attached metallic electrodes. We demonstrate that such \"pseudo-diffusive\" shot noise can be substantially modified in zigzag graphene nanoribbon (ZGNR) due to the topology of its edges responsible for localized states that facilitate ferromagnetic ordering along the edge when Coulomb interaction is taken into account. Thus, the shot noise enhancement of unpolarized, and even more sensitively of spin-polarized, charge currents injected into ZGNR will act as an all-electrical and edge-sensitive probe of such low-dimensional magnetism.",

        "Authors": "Dimitri Veras,Eric B. Ford",
        "Abstract": "The eccentricity evolution of multiple planet systems can provide valuable constraints on planet formation models. Unfortunately, the inevitable uncertainties in the current orbital elements can lead to significant ambiguities in the nature of the secular evolution. Integrating any single set of orbital elements inadequately describes the full range of secular evolutions consistent with current observations. Thus, we combine radial velocity observations of HD 12661 with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to generate ensembles of initial conditions for direct n-body integrations. We find that any mean motion resonances are quite weak and do not significantly impact the secular evolution, and that current observations indicate circulation or large amplitude libration of the periapses. The eccentricity of the outer planet undergoes large oscillations for nearly all of the allowed two-planet orbital solutions. This type of secular evolution would arise if planet c had been impulsively perturbed, perhaps due to strong scattering of an additional planet that was subsequently accreted onto the star. Finally, we note that the secular evolution implied by the current orbital configuration implies that planet c spends ~96% of the time following an orbit more eccentric than that presently observed. Either this system is being observed during a relatively rare state, or additional planets are affecting the observed radial velocities and/or the system's secular eccentricity evolution.",

        "Authors": "S. Blondin,J. L. Prieto,F. Patat,P. Challis,M. Hicken,R. P. Kirshner,T. Matheson,M. Modjaz",
        "Abstract": "(Original) Recent high-resolution spectra of the Type Ia SN 2006X have revealed the presence of time-variable and blueshifted Na I D features, interpreted by Patat et al. as originating in circumstellar material within the progenitor system. The variation seen in SN 2006X induces relatively large changes in the total Na I D equivalent width ($\\Delta\\rm{EW}\\approx 0.5 \\unicode{x212B}$ in just over two weeks), that would be detectable at lower resolutions. We have used a large data set comprising 2400 low-resolution spectra of 450 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained by the CfA Supernova Program to search for variable Na I D features. Out of the 31 SNe Ia (including SN 2006X) in which we could have detected similar EW variations, only one other (SN 1999cl) shows variable Na I D features, with an even larger change over a similar ~10-day timescale ($\\Delta\\rm{EW} = 1.66 \\pm 0.21 \\unicode{x212B}$). Interestingly, both SN 1999cl and SN 2006X are the two most highly-reddened objects in our sample, raising the possibility that the variability is connected to dusty environments.(Erratum) The large variation in the Na I D equivalent width observed in SN 1999cl results in fact from a measurement error. Our new measurements show that the EW variation is significantly lower, at $0.43 \\pm 0.14 \\unicode{x212B}$. While the EW variation remains statistically significant (3.1$\\sigma$ different from zero), it is now below the detection threshold of 0.5 $\\unicode{x212B}$ derived from the Monte Carlo simulations published in the original paper. As a result, SN 1999cl should no longer be considered as an object displaying variable Na I D lines in our study. The fraction of SNe Ia in our sample displaying Na I D lines thus goes from $\\sim$6% (2/31) in the original study to $\\sim$3% (1/31) in the revised analysis, SN 2006X being the only SN Ia in our sample with variable Na I D lines.",

        "Authors": "Keith S. M. Lee,Frank J. Tackmann",
        "Abstract": "Recently, it was shown that in inclusive B -> Xs l+ l- decay, an angular decomposition provides three independent (q^2 dependent) observables. A strategy was formulated to extract all measurable Wilson coefficients in B -> Xs l+ l- from a few simple integrals of these observables in the low q^2 region. The experimental measurements in the low q^2 region require a cut on the hadronic invariant mass, which introduces a dependence on nonperturbative b quark distribution functions. The associated hadronic uncertainties could potentially limit the sensitivity of these decays to new physics. We compute the nonperturbative corrections to all three observables at leading and subleading order in the power expansion in \\Lambda_QCD/m_b. We find that the subleading power corrections give sizeable corrections, of order -5% to -10% depending on the observable and the precise value of the hadronic mass cut. They cause a shift of order -0.05 GeV^2 to -0.1 GeV^2 in the zero of the forward-backward asymmetry.",

We then outline a stringent model-independent program to test gravity on cosmological scales. We illustrate the feasibility of such a program by jointly using several observables like peculiar velocities, galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing. After addressing possible observational or astrophysical caveats like galaxy bias and redshift uncertainties, we forecast in particular how well one can predict the lensing signal from a cosmic shear survey using an over-lapping galaxy survey. We finally discuss the specific physics probed this way and illustrate how $f(R)$ gravity models would fail such a test.",

These parton distributions supersede the previously available \"MRST\" sets and should be used for the first LHC data-taking and for the associated theoretical calculations. New data sets fitted include CCFR/NuTeV dimuon cross sections, which constrain the strange quark and antiquark distributions, and Tevatron Run II data on inclusive jet production, the lepton charge asymmetry from W decays and the Z rapidity distribution. Uncertainties are propagated from the experimental errors on the fitted data points using a new dynamic procedure for each eigenvector of the covariance matrix. We discuss the major changes compared to previous MRST fits, briefly compare to parton distributions obtained by other fitting groups, and give predictions for the W and Z total cross sections at the Tevatron and LHC.",

        "Abstract": "We present a comprehensive study of rotation, disk and accretion signatures for 144 T Tauri stars in the young (~2 Myr old) Chamaeleon I and Taurus-Auriga star forming regions based on multi-epoch high-resolution optical spectra from the Magellan Clay 6.5 m telescope supplemented by mid-infared photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope. In contrast to previous studies in the Orion Nebula Cluster and NGC 2264, we do not see a clear signature of disk braking in Tau-Aur and Cha I. We find that both accretors and non-accretors have similar distributions of v sin i. The rotational velocities in both regions show a clear mass dependence, with F--K stars rotating on average about twice as fast as M stars, consistent with results reported for other clusters of similar age. Similarly, we find the upper envelope of the observed values of specific angular momentum j varies as M^0.5 for our sample which spans a mass range of ~0.16 to ~3 M_sun. This power law complements previous studies in Orion which estimated j is proportional to M^0.25 for < ~2 Myr stars in the same mass regime, and a sharp decline in j with decreasing mass for older stars (~10 Myr) with M < 2 M_sun. For a subsample of 67 objects with mid-IR photometry, we examine the connection between accretion signatures and dusty disks: in the vast majority of cases (63/67), the two properties correlate well, which suggests that the timescale of gas accretion is similar to the lifetime of inner disks.",

This is realised by levitating a black hole over a magnetic dipole base. We comment on how such a construction resembles a mechanical Levitron.",

        "Authors": "Yungui Gong,Mustapha Ishak,Anzhong Wang",
        "Abstract": "The growth rate of matter perturbation and the expansion rate of the Universe can be used to distinguish modified gravity and dark energy models in explaining cosmic acceleration. We explore here the inclusion of spatial curvature into the growth factor. We expand previous results using the approximation $\\Omega_{m}^\\gamma$ and then suggest a new form, $f_a=\\Omega_m^\\gamma+(\\gamma-4/7)\\Omega_k$, as an approximation for the growth factor when the curvature $\\Omega_k$ is not negligible, and where the growth index $\\gamma$ is usually model dependent. The expression recovers the standard results for the curved and flat $\\Lambda$CDM and Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati models. Using the best fit values of $\\Omega_{m0}$ and $\\Omega_{k0}$ to the expansion/distance measurements from Type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillation, WMAP5, and $H(z)$ data, we fit the growth index parameter to current growth factor data and obtain $\\gamma_{\\Lambda}(\\Omega_{k} \\not= 0) = 0.65^{+0.17}_{-0.15}$ and $\\gamma_{DGP}(\\Omega_{k} \\not= 0) = 0.53^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$. For the $\\Lambda$CDM model, the 1-$\\sigma$ observational bounds are found consistent with theoretical value, unlike the case for the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model. We also find that the current data we used is not enough to put significant constraints when the 3 parameters in $f_a$ are fit simultaneously. Importantly, we find that, in the presence of curvature, the analytical expression proposed for $f_a$ provides a better fit to the growth factor than other forms and should be useful for future high precision missions and studies.",

        "Authors": "Charlie Conroy,Martin White,James E. Gunn",
        "Abstract": "Models for the formation and evolution of galaxies readily predict physical properties such as the star formation rates, metal enrichment histories, and, increasingly, gas and dust content of synthetic galaxies. Such predictions are frequently compared to the spectral energy distributions of observed galaxies via the stellar population synthesis (SPS) technique. Substantial uncertainties in SPS exist, and yet their relevance to the task of comparing galaxy evolution models to observations has received little attention. In the present work we begin to address this issue by investigating the importance of uncertainties in stellar evolution, the initial stellar mass function (IMF), and dust and interstellar medium (ISM) properties on the translation from models to observations. We demonstrate that these uncertainties translate into substantial uncertainties in the ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared colors of synthetic galaxies. Aspects that carry significant uncertainties include the logarithmic slope of the IMF above 1 Msun, dust attenuation law, molecular cloud disruption timescale, clumpiness of the ISM, fraction of unobscured starlight, and treatment of advanced stages of stellar evolution including blue stragglers, the horizontal branch, and the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch. The interpretation of the resulting uncertainties in the derived colors is highly non-trivial because many of the uncertainties are likely systematic, and possibly correlated with the physical properties of galaxies. We therefore urge caution when comparing models to observations.",

We find that out of a uniform sample of 29 Swift bursts rapidly observed by the Palomar 60-inch telescope through March 2008 (14 of which we classify as dark), all events have either a detected optical afterglow, a probable optical host-galaxy detection, or both. Our results constrain the fraction of Swift GRBs coming from very high redshift (z > 7), such as the recent GRB 090423, to between 0.2-7 percent at 80% confidence. In contrast, a significant fraction of the sample requires large extinction columns (host-frame A_V > 1 mag, with several events showing A_V > 2-6 mag), identifying dust extinction as the dominant cause of the dark GRB phenomenon. We infer that a significant fraction of GRBs (and, by association, of high-mass star formation) occurs in highly obscured regions. However, the host galaxies of dark GRBs seem to have normal optical colors, suggesting that the source of obscuring dust is local to the vicinity of the GRB progenitor or highly unevenly distributed within the host galaxy.",

Graded quiver varieties controlling the image can be identified with varieties which Lusztig used to define the canonical base. The cluster monomials form a subset of the base given by the classes of simple modules in R, or Lusztig's dual canonical base. The positivity and linearly independence (and probably many other) conjectures of cluster monomials [arXiv:math/0104151] follow as consequences, when there is a seed with a bipartite quiver.

We find that for low-mass dark matter models, data in the X-ray band provide the most stringent constraints, while the gamma-ray energy range probes models featuring large masses and pair-annihilation rates, and a hard spectrum for the injected electrons and positrons. Specifically, we point out that the all-redshift, all-halo inverse Compton emission from many dark matter models that might provide an explanation to the anomalous positron fraction measured by the Pamela payload severely overproduces the observed extragalactic gamma-ray background.",

        "Abstract": "The DAMA/LIBRA collaboration has detected an annual modulation of the recoil rate in NaI crystals with the phase expected for WIMP scattering events. This signal is dramatically inconsistent with upper limits from other experiments for elastically scattering weak-scale WIMPs. However, the results are compatible for the case of inelastic dark matter (iDM). The iDM theory, as implemented by Tucker-Smith and Weiner, constrains the WIMP to a tight contour in sigma_n-delta space, where delta is the mass difference between the ground state and excited WIMPs. An urgent priority in direct detection is to test this scenario. The crucial test of the iDM explanation of DAMA -- an \"experimentum crucis\" -- is an experiment with directional sensitivity, which can measure the daily modulation in direction. Because the contrast can be 100%, it is a sharper test than the much smaller annual modulation in the rate. We estimate the significance of such an experiment as a function of the WIMP mass, cross section, background rate, and other parameters. The proposed experiment severely constrains the DAMA/iDM scenario even with modest exposure (~1000 kg day) on gaseous xenon.",

        "Abstract": "A vertex coloring of a graph is called \"perfect\" if for any two colors $a$ and $b$, the number of the color-$b$ neighbors of a color-$a$ vertex $x$ does not depend on the choice of $x$, that is, depends only on $a$ and $b$ (the corresponding partition of the vertex set is known as \"equitable\"). A set of vertices is called \"completely regular\" if the coloring according to the distance from this set is perfect. By the \"weight distribution\" of some coloring with respect to some set we mean the information about the number of vertices of every color at every distance from the set. We study the weight distribution of a perfect coloring (equitable partition) of a graph with respect to a completely regular set (in particular, with respect to a vertex if the graph is distance-regular). We show how to compute this distribution by the knowledge of the color composition over the set. For some partial cases of completely regular sets, we derive explicit formulas of weight distributions. Since any (other) completely regular set itself generates a perfect coloring, this gives universal formulas for calculating the weight distribution of any completely regular set from its parameters. In the case of Hamming graphs, we prove a very simple formula for the weight enumerator of an arbitrary perfect coloring. Codewords: completely regular code; equitable partition; partition design; perfect coloring; perfect structure; regular partition; weight distribution; weight enumerator.",

        "Authors": "Denis Krotov(Sobolev Institute of Mathematics, Novosibirsk, Russia)",
        "Abstract": "We show that any binary $(n=2^m-3, 2^{n-m}, 3)$ code $C_1$ is a part of an equitable partition (perfect coloring) $\\{C_1,C_2,C_3,C_4\\}$ of the $n$-cube with the parameters $((0,1,n-1,0)(1,0,n-1,0)(1,1,n-4,2)(0,0,n-1,1))$. Now the possibility to lengthen the code $C_1$ to a 1-perfect code of length $n+2$ is equivalent to the possibility to split the part $C_4$ into two distance-3 codes or, equivalently, to the biparticity of the graph of distances 1 and 2 of $C_4$. In any case, $C_1$ is uniquely embeddable in a twofold 1-perfect code of length $n+2$ with some structural restrictions, where by a twofold 1-perfect code we mean that any vertex of the space is within radius 1 from exactly two codewords.",

        "Abstract": "We compare the optical spectral types with the X-ray spectral properties for a uniformly selected (sources with fluxes greater than the 3 sigma level and above a flux limit of f_2-8 keV > 3.5x10^-15 erg/cm2/s), highly spectroscopically complete (>80% for f_2-8 keV > 10^-14 erg/cm2/s and >60% below) 2-8 keV X-ray sample observed in three Chandra fields (CLANS, CLASXS, and the CDF-N) that cover ~1.2 deg^2. For our sample of 645 spectroscopically observed sources, we confirm that there is significant overlap of the X-ray spectral properties, as determined by the effective photon indices, Geff, obtained from the ratios of the 0.5-2 keV to 2-8 keV counts, for the different optical spectral types. For example, of the broad-line AGNs (non-broad-line AGNs), 20% +/- 3% (33% +/- 4%) have Geff<1.2 (Geff > 1.2). Thus, one cannot use the X-ray spectral classifications and the optical spectral classifications equivalently. Since it is not understood how X-ray and optical classifications relate to the obscuration of the central engine, we strongly advise against a mixed classification scheme, as it can only complicate the interpretation of X-ray AGN samples. We confirm the dependence of optical spectral type on X-ray luminosity, and for z<1, we find a similar luminosity dependence of Geff. However, this dependence breaks down at higher redshifts due to the highly redshift-dependent nature of Geff. We therefore also caution that any classification scheme which depends on Geff is likely to suffer from serious redshift bias.",

        "Abstract": "We show that the class of antenna layouts for telescope arrays allowing cheap analysis hardware (with correlator cost scaling as N log N rather than N^2 with the number of antennas N) is encouragingly large, including not only previously discussed rectangular grids but also arbitrary hierarchies of such grids, with arbitrary rotations and shears at each level. We show that all correlations for such a 2D array with an n-level hierarchy can be efficiently computed via a Fast Fourier Transform in not 2 but 2n dimensions. This can allow major correlator cost reductions for science applications requiring exquisite sensitivity at widely separated angular scales, for example 21cm tomography (where short baselines are needed to probe the cosmological signal and long baselines are needed for point source removal), helping enable future 21cm experiments with thousands or millions of cheap dipole-like antennas. Such hierarchical grids combine the angular resolution advantage of traditional array layouts with the cost advantage of a rectangular Fast Fourier Transform Telescope. We also describe an algorithm for how a subclass of hierarchical arrays can efficiently use rotation synthesis to produce global sky maps with minimal noise and a well-characterized synthesized beam.",

        "Authors": "A. Reiners,J.L. Bean,K.F. Huber,S. Dreizler,A. Seifahrt,S. Czesla",
        "Abstract": "The detection of planets around very low-mass stars with the radial velocity method is hampered by the fact that these stars are very faint at optical wavelengths where the most high-precision spectrometers operate. We investigate the precision that can be achieved in radial velocity measurements of low mass stars in the near infrared (nIR) Y-, J-, and H-bands, and we compare it to the precision achievable in the optical. For early-M stars, radial velocity measurements in the nIR offer no or only marginal advantage in comparison to optical measurements. Although they emit more flux in the nIR, the richness of spectral features in the optical outweighs the flux difference. We find that nIR measurement can be as precise than optical measurements in stars of spectral type ~M4, and from there the nIR gains in precision towards cooler objects. We studied potential calibration strategies in the nIR finding that a stable spectrograph with a ThAr calibration can offer enough wavelength stability for m/s precision. Furthermore, we simulate the wavelength-dependent influence of activity (cool spots) on radial velocity measurements from optical to nIR wavelengths. Our spot simulations reveal that the radial velocity jitter does not decrease as dramatically towards longer wavelengths as often thought. The jitter strongly depends on the details of the spots, i.e., on spot temperature and the spectral appearance of the spot. Forthcoming nIR spectrographs will allow the search for planets with a particular advantage in mid- and late-M stars. Activity will remain an issue, but simultaneous observations at optical and nIR wavelengths can provide strong constraints on spot properties in active stars.",

        "Abstract": "We use the ultra-deep WFC3/IR data over the HUDF and the Early Release Science WFC3/IR data over the CDF-South GOODS field to quantify the broadband spectral properties of candidate star-forming galaxies at z~7. We determine the UV-continuum slope beta in these galaxies, and compare the slopes with galaxies at later times to measure the evolution in beta. For luminous L*(z=3) galaxies, we measure a mean UV-continuum slope beta of -2.0+/-0.2, which is comparable to the beta~-2 derived at similar luminosities at z~5-6. However, for the lower luminosity 0.1L*(z=3) galaxies, we measure a mean beta of -3.0+/-0.2. This is substantially bluer than is found for similar luminosity galaxies at z~4, just 800 Myr later, and even at z~5-6. In principle, the observed beta of -3.0 can be matched by a very young, dust-free stellar population, but when nebular emission is included the expected beta becomes >~-2.7. To produce these very blue beta's (i.e., beta~-3), extremely low metallicities and mechanisms to reduce the red nebular emission are likely required. For example, a large escape fraction (i.e., f_{esc}>~0.3) could minimize the contribution from this red nebular emission. If this is correct and the escape fraction in faint z~7 galaxies is >~0.3, it may help to explain how galaxies reionize the universe.",

        "Authors": "Elena M. Rossi,G. Lodato,P. J. Armitage,J. E. Pringle,A. R. King",
        "Abstract": "The coalescence of supermassive black hole binaries occurs via the emission of gravitational waves, that can impart a substantial recoil to the merged black hole. We consider the energy dissipation, that results if the recoiling black hole is surrounded by a thin circumbinary disc. Our results differ significantly from those of previous investigations. We show analytically that the dominant source of energy is often potential energy, released as gas in the outer disc attempts to circularize at smaller radii. Thus, dimensional estimates, that include only the kinetic energy gained by the disc gas, underestimate the real energy loss. This underestimate can exceed an order of magnitude, if the recoil is directed close to the disc plane. We use three dimensional Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations and two dimensional finite difference simulations to verify our analytic estimates. We also compute the bolometric light curve, which is found to vary strongly depending upon the kick angle. A prompt emission signature due to this mechanism may be observable for low mass (10^6 Solar mass) black holes whose recoil velocities exceed about 1000 km/s. Emission at earlier times can mainly result from the response of the disc to the loss of mass, as the black holes merge. We derive analytically the condition for this to happen.",

        "Authors": "M. Kachelriess,P.D. Serpico,M.Aa. Solberg",
        "Abstract": "Interpretations of indirect searches for dark matter (DM) require theoretical predictions for the annihilation or decay rates of DM into stable particles of the standard model. These predictions include usually only final states accessible as lowest order tree-level processes, with electromagnetic bremsstrahlung and the loop-suppressed two gamma-ray line as exceptions. We show that this restriction may lead to severely biased results for DM tailored to produce only leptons in final states and with mass in the TeV range. For such models, unavoidable electroweak bremsstrahlung of Z and W-bosons has a significant influence both on the branching ratio and the spectral shape of the final state particles. We work out the consequences for two situations: Firstly, the idealized case where DM annihilates at tree level with 100% branching ratio into neutrinos. For a given cross section, this leads eventually to \"minimal yields\" of photons, electrons, positrons and antiprotons. Secondly, the case where the only allowed two-body final states are electrons. The latter case is typical of models aimed at fitting cosmic ray e^- and e^+ data. We find that the multimessenger signatures of such models can be significantly modified with respect to results presented in the literature.",

The AT20G is a blind radio survey carried out at 20 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) from 2004 to 2008, and covers the whole sky south of declination 0 deg. The AT20G source catalogue presented here is an order of magnitude larger than any previous catalogue of high-frequency radio sources, and includes 5890 sources above a 20 GHz flux-density limit of 40 mJy. All AT20G sources have total intensity and polarisation measured at 20 GHz, and most sources south of declination -15 deg also have near-simultaneous flux-density measurements at 5 and 8 GHz. A total of 1559 sources were detected in polarised total intensity at one or more of the three frequencies. We detect a small but significant population of non-thermal sources that are either undetected or have only weak detections in low-frequency catalogues. We introduce the term Ultra-Inverted Spectrum (UIS) to describe these radio sources, which have a spectral index alpha(5, 20) > +0.7 and which constitute roughly 1.2 per cent of the AT20G sample. The 20 GHz flux densities measured for the strongest AT20G sources are in excellent agreement with the WMAP 5-year source catalogue of Wright et al. (2009), and we find that the WMAP source catalogue is close to complete for sources stronger than 1.5 Jy at 23 GHz.",

We find that the jets of these blazars are among the most powerful known. Furthermore, the mass of their central black hole, inferred from the optical-UV bump, exceeds a few billions of solar masses, with accretion luminosities being a large fraction of the Eddington one. We compare their properties with those of the brightest blazars of the 3-months survey performed by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi satellite. We find that the BAT blazars have more powerful jets, more luminous accretion disks and larger black hole masses than LAT blazars. These findings can be simply understood on the basis of the blazar sequence, that suggests that the most powerful blazars have a spectral energy distribution with a high energy peak at MeV (or even sub-MeV) energies. This implies that the most extreme blazars can be found more efficiently in hard X-rays, rather than in the high energy gamma-ray band. We then discuss the implications of our findings for future missions, such as the New Hard X-ray Mission (NHXM) and especially the Energetic X-ray Imaging Survey Telescope (EXIST) mission which, during its planned 2 years all sky survey, is expected to detect thousands of blazars, with a few of them at z greater than 6.",

        "Abstract": "Using numerical modeling and a grid of synthetic spectra, we examine the effects that unresolved binaries have on the determination of various stellar atmospheric parameters for SEGUE targets measured using the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline (SSPP). To model undetected binaries that may be in the SEGUE sample, we use a variety of mass distributions for the primary and secondary stars in conjunction with empirically determined relationships for orbital parameters to determine the fraction of G-K dwarf stars, as defined by SDSS color cuts, that will be blended with a secondary companion. We focus on the G-K dwarf sample in SEGUE as it records the history of chemical enrichment in our galaxy. To determine the effect of the secondary on the spectroscopic parameters, we synthesize a grid of model spectra from 3275 to 7850 K (~0.1 to 1.0 \\msun) and [Fe/H]=-0.5 to -2.5 from MARCS model atmospheres using TurboSpectrum. We analyze both \"infinite\" signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) models and degraded versions, at median S/N of 50, 25 and 10. By running individual and combined spectra (representing the binaries) through the SSPP, we determine that ~10% of the blended G-K dwarf pairs with S/N>=25 will have their atmospheric parameter determinations, in particular temperature and metallicity, noticeably affected by the presence of an undetected secondary. To account for the additional uncertainty from binary contamination at a S/N~10, uncertainties of ~140 K and ~0.17 dex in [Fe/H] must be added in quadrature to the published uncertainties of the SSPP.

We find that (i) the [Ca/H] variations between first and second generation stars are tiny in most GCs (~0.02-0.03 dex, comparable with typical observational errors). In addition, (ii) using a large sample of red giants in M 4 with abundances from UVES spectra from Marino et al. (2008), we find that Ca and Fe abundances in the two populations of Na-poor and Na-rich stars are identical. These facts suggest that the separation seen in color-magnitude diagrams using the U band or hk index (as observed in NGC 1851 by Han et al. 2009) are not due to Ca variations. Small differences in [Ca/H] as associated to hk variations might be due to a small systematic effect in abundance analysis, because most O-poor/Na-rich (He-rich) stars have slightly larger [Fe/H] (by 0.027 dex on average, due to decreased H in the ratio) than first generation stars and are then located at redder positions in the V,hk plane. While a few GCs (M 54, omega Cen, M 22, maybe even NGC 1851) do actually show various degree of metallicity spread, our findings eliminate the need of a close link between the enrichment by core-collapse SNe with the mechanism responsible for the Na-O anticorrelation.",

        "Abstract": "We test General Relativity (GR) using current cosmological data: the cosmic microwave background (CMB) from WMAP5 (Komatsu et al. 2009), the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect from the cross-correlation of the CMB with six galaxy catalogs (Giannantonio et al. 2008), a compilation of supernovae Type Ia (SNe) including the latest SDSS SNe (Kessler et al. 2009), and part of the weak lensing (WL) data from CFHTLS (Fu et al. 2008, Kilbinger et al. 2009) that probe linear and mildly non-linear scales. We first test a model where the effective Newton's constant, mu, and the ratio of the two gravitational potentials, eta, transit from the GR value to another constant at late times; in this case, we find that standard GR is fully consistent with the combined data. The strongest constraint comes from the ISW effect which would arise from this gravitational transition; the observed ISW signal imposes a tight constraint on a combination of mu and eta that characterizes the lensing potential. Next, we consider four pixels in time and space for each function mu and eta, and perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) finding that seven of the resulting eight eigenmodes are consistent with GR within the errors. Only one eigenmode shows a 2-sigma deviation from the GR prediction, which is likely to be due to a systematic effect. However, the detection of such a deviation demonstrates the power of our time- and scale-dependent PCA methodology when combining observations of structure formation and expansion history to test GR.",

        "Title": "Systematic Effects in Extracting a \"Gamma-Ray Haze\" from Spatial Templates",
        "Authors": "Tim Linden(UC Santa Cruz),Stefano Profumo(UC Santa Cruz)",
        "Abstract": "Recent claims of a gamma-ray excess in the diffuse galactic emission detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope with a morphology similar to the WMAP haze were based on the assumption that spatial templates of the interstellar medium (ISM) column density and the 408 Mhz sky are good proxies for neutral pion and inverse Compton (IC) gamma-ray emission, respectively. We identify significant systematic effects in this procedure that can artificially induce an additional diffuse component with a morphology strikingly similar to the claimed gamma-ray haze. To quantitatively illustrate this point we calculate sky-maps of the ratio of the gamma-ray emission from neutral pions to the ISM column density, and of IC to synchrotron emission, using detailed galactic cosmic-ray models and simulations. In the region above and below the galactic center, the ISM template underestimates the gamma-ray emission due to neutral pion decay by approximately 20%. Additionally, the synchrotron template tends to under-estimate the IC emission at low energies (few GeV) and to over-estimate it at higher energies (tens of GeV) by potentially large factors that depend crucially on the assumed magnetic field structure of the Galaxy. The size of the systematic effects we find are comparable to the size of the claimed \"Fermi haze\" signal. We thus conclude that a detailed model for the galactic diffuse emission is necessary in order to conclusively assess the presence of a gamma-ray excess possibly associated to the WMAP haze morphology.",

First discovered over a decade ago, they have allowed us to probe the early Universe, as their strong emission line compensates for their faint continuum light.  While initially thought to be indicative of the first galaxies forming in the Universe, recent studies have shown them to be increasingly complex, as some fraction appear evolved, and many LAEs appear to be dusty, which one would not expect from primordial galaxies.  Presently, much interest resides in discovering not only the highest redshift galaxies to constrain theories of reionization, but also pushing closer to home, as previous ground-based studies have only found LAEs at z > 3 due to observational limitations.  In this review talk I will cover everything from the first theoretical predictions of LAEs, to their future prospects for study, including the HETDEX survey here in Texas.",

        "Abstract": "We study the effect of impurities in a supersolid phase in comparison to the behavior in the solid and superfluid phases. A supersolid phase has been established for interacting hardcore bosons on a triangular lattice which may be realizable by ultracold atomic gases. Static vacancies are considered in this model which always lower the magnitude of the order parameter in the solid or superfluid phases. In the supersolid phase, however, the impurities directly affect both order parameters simultaneously and thereby reveal an interesting interplay between them. In particular the solid order may be enhanced at the cost of a strong reduction of the superfluidity, which shows that the two order parameters cannot be in a simple superposition. We also observe an unusual impurity pinning effect in the solid ordered phase, which results in two distinct states separated by a first-order transition.",

        "Abstract": "The standard lore about the sum over topological sectors in quantum field theory is that locality and cluster decomposition uniquely determine the sum over such sectors, thus leading to the usual theta-vacua. We show that without changing the local degrees of freedom, a theory can be modified such that the sum over instantons should be restricted; e.g. one should include only instanton numbers which are divisible by some integer p. This conclusion about the configuration space of quantum field theory allows us to carefully reconsider the quantization of parameters in supergravity. In particular, we show that FI-terms and nontrivial Kahler forms are quantized. This analysis also leads to a new derivation of recent results about linearized supergravity.",

In the vacuum limit, modes with different energies quickly de-phase (kinematical decoherence), whereas in the limit of infinite density they lock to each other (synchronization). For intermediate densities, we find different classes of solutions. There is always a phase transition in the sense of partial synchronization occurring only above a density threshold. For small mixing angles, partial or complete decoherence can be induced by a parametric resonance, introducing a new time scale to the problem, the final outcome depending on the spectrum and mixing angle. We derive an analytic relation that allows us to calculate the late-time degree of coherence based on the spectrum alone.",

        "Authors": "Marcelo A. Alvarez,Ue-Li Pen,Tzu-Ching Chang",
        "Abstract": "Before the universe was reionized, it was likely that the spin temperature of intergalactic hydrogen was decoupled from the CMB by UV radiation from the first stars through the Wouthuysen-Field effect. If the IGM had not yet been heated above the CMB temperature by that time, then the gas would appear in absorption relative to the CMB. Large, rare sources of X-rays could inject sufficient heat into the neutral IGM, so that the differential brightness temperature was greater than zero at comoving distances of tens to hundreds of Mpc, resulting in large 21-cm fluctuations with amplitudes of about 250 mK on arcminute to degree angular scales, an order of magnitude larger in amplitude than that caused by ionized bubbles during reionization, about 25 mK. This signal could therefore be easier to detect and probe higher redshifts than that due to patchy reionization. For the case in which the first objects to heat the IGM are QSOs hosting 10^7-solar mass black holes with an abundance exceeding about 1 per Gpc^3 at z~15, observations with either the Arecibo Observatory or the Five Hundred Meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) could detect and image their fluctuations at greater than 5-sigma significance in about a month of dedicated survey time. Additionally, existing facilities such as MWA and LOFAR could detect the statistical fluctuations arising from a population of 10^5-solar mass black holes with an abundance of about 10^4 per Gpc^3 at z~10-12.",

        "Abstract": "The search for substellar companions around stars with different masses along the main sequence is critical to understand the different processes leading to the formation of low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and planets. In particular, the existence of a large population of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs physically bound to early-type main-sequence stars could imply that the massive planets recently imaged at wide separations (10-100 AU) around A-type stars are disc-born objects in the low-mass tail of the binary distribution. Our aim is to characterize the environment of early-type main-sequence stars by detecting brown dwarf or low-mass star companions between 10 and 500 AU. High contrast and high angular resolution near-infrared images of a sample of 38 southern A- and F-type stars have been obtained between 2005 and 2009 with the instruments VLT/NaCo and CFHT/PUEO. Multi-epoch observations were performed to discriminate comoving companions from background contaminants. About 41 companion candidates were imaged around 23 stars. Follow-up observations for 83% of these stars allowed us to identify a large number of background contaminants. We report the detection of 7 low-mass stars with masses between 0.1 and 0.8 Msun in 6 multiple systems: the discovery of a M2 companion around the A5V star HD14943 and the detection of the B component of the F4V star HD41742 quadruple system; we resolve the known companion of the F6.5V star HD49095 as a short-period binary system composed by 2 M/L dwarfs. We also resolve the companions to the astrometric binaries iot Crt (F6.5V) and 26 Oph (F3V), and identify a M3/M4 companion to the F4V star omi Gru, associated with a X-ray source. The global multiplicity fraction measured in our sample of A and F stars is >16%. A parallel velocimetric survey of our stars let us conclude that the imaged companions can impact on the observed radial velocity measurements.",

        "Abstract": "Due to the recent dramatic technological advances, infrared interferometry can now be applied to new classes of objects, resulting in exciting new science prospects, for instance, in the area of high-mass star formation. Although extensively studied at various wavelengths, the process through which massive stars form is still only poorly understood. For instance, it has been proposed that massive stars might form like low-mass stars by mass accretion through a circumstellar disk/envelope, or otherwise by coalescence in a dense stellar cluster. After discussing the technological challenges which result from the special properties of these objects, we present first near-infrared interferometric observations, which we obtained on the massive YSO IRAS 13481-6124 using VLTI/AMBER infrared long-baseline interferometry and NTT speckle interferometry. From our extensive data set, we reconstruct a model-independent aperture synthesis image which shows an elongated structure with a size of 13x19 AU, consistent with a disk seen under an inclination of 45 degree. The measured wavelength-dependent visibilities and closure phases allow us to derive the radial disk temperature gradient and to detect a dust-free region inside of 9.5 AU from the star, revealing qualitative and quantitative similarities with the disks observed in low-mass star formation. In complementary mid-infrared Spitzer and sub-millimeter APEX imaging observations we detect two bow shocks and a molecular out ow which are oriented perpendicular to the disk plane and indicate the presence of a bipolar outflow emanating from the inner regions of the system.",

        "Abstract": "The dissipative XY model in two spatial dimensions belongs to a new universality class of quantum critical phenomena with the remarkable property of the decoupling of the critical fluctuations in space and time. We have shown earlier that the quantum critical point is driven by proliferation in time of topological configurations that we termed warps. We show here that a warp may be regarded as a configuration of a monopoles surrounded symmetrically by anti-monopoles so that the total charge of the configuration is zero. Therefore the interaction with other warps is local in space. They however interact with other warps at the same spatial point logarithmically in time. As a function of dissipation warps unbind leading to a quantum phase transition. The critical fluctuations are momentum independent but have power law correlations in time.",

        "Authors": "David L. Nidever,Steven R. Majewski,W. Butler Burton,Lou Nigra",
        "Abstract": "We establish that the Magellanic Stream (MS) is some 40 degrees longer than previously known with certainty and that the entire MS and Leading Arm (LA) system is thus at least 200 degrees long. With the GBT, we conducted a ~200 square degree, 21-cm survey at the MS-tip to substantiate the continuity of the MS between the Hulsbosch & Wakker data and the MS-like emission reported by Braun & Thilker. Our survey, in combination with the Arecibo survey by Stanimirovic et al., shows that the MS gas is continuous in this region and that the MS is at least ~140 degrees long. We identify a new filament on the eastern side of the MS that significantly deviates from the equator of the MS coordinate system for more than ~45 degrees. Additionally, we find a previously unknown velocity inflection in the MS-tip near MS longitude L_MS=-120 degrees at which the velocity reaches a minimum and then starts to increase. We find that five compact high velocity clouds cataloged by de Heij et al. as well as Wright's Cloud are plausibly associated with the MS because they match the MS in position and velocity. The mass of the newly-confirmed ~40 degree extension of the MS-tip is ~2x10^7 Msun (d/120 kpc)^2 (including Wright's Cloud increases this by ~50%) and increases the total mass of the MS by ~4%. However, projected model distances of the MS at the tip are generally quite large and, if true, indicate that the mass of the extension might be as large as ~10^8 Msun. From our combined map of the entire MS, we find that the total column density (integrated transverse to the MS) drops markedly along the MS and follows an exponential decline with L_MS. We estimate that the age of the ~140 degree-long MS is ~2.5 Gyr which coincides with bursts of star formation in the Magellanic Clouds and a possible close encounter of these two galaxies with each other that could have triggered the formation of the MS.

        "Abstract": "We study the evolution of star formation activity of galaxies at 0.5<z<3.5 as a function of stellar mass, using very deep NIR data taken with Multi-Object Infrared Camera and Spectrograph (MOIRCS) on the Subaru telescope in the GOODS-North region. The NIR imaging data reach K ~ 23-24 Vega magnitude and they allow us to construct a nearly stellar mass-limited sample down to ~ 10^{9.5-10} Msun even at z~3. We estimated star formation rates (SFRs) of the sample with two indicators, namely, the Spitzer/MIPS 24um flux and the rest-frame 2800A luminosity. The SFR distribution at a fixed Mstar shifts to higher values with increasing redshift at 0.5<z<3.5. More massive galaxies show stronger evolution of SFR at z>~1. We found galaxies at 2.5<z<3.5 show a bimodality in their SSFR distribution, which can be divided into two populations by a constant SSFR of ~2 Gyr^{-1}. Galaxies in the low-SSFR group have SSFRs of ~ 0.5-1.0 Gyr^{-1}, while the high-SSFR population shows ~10 Gyr^{-1}. The cosmic SFRD is dominated by galaxies with Mstar = 10^{10-11} Msun at 0.5<z<3.5, while the contribution of massive galaxies with Mstar = 10^{11-11.5} Msun shows a strong evolution at z>1 and becomes significant at z~3, especially in the case with the SFR based on MIPS 24um. In galaxies with Mstar = 10^{10-11.5} Msun, those with a relatively narrow range of SSFR (<~1 dex) dominates the cosmic SFRD at 0.5<z<3.5. The SSFR of galaxies which dominate the SFRD systematically increases with redshift. At 2.5<z<3.5, the high-SSFR population, which is relatively small in number, dominates the SFRD. Major star formation in the universe at higher redshift seems to be associated with a more rapid growth of stellar mass of galaxies.",

One would be a purely optical wide-field camera, with large format and small pixels, optimized for weak-lensing, which because of its simple design, could be launched by ESA on relatively short timescales. The second would be a purely infrared satellite with marginally-sampled or under-sampled pixels, launched by NASA. Because of budget constraints, this would be launched several years later. The two would complement one another in 3 dark energy experiments (weak lensing, baryon oscillations, supernovae) and also in microlensing planet searches. Signed international agreements would guarantee the later NASA launch, and on this basis equal access of both US and European scientists to both data sets.",

Based on this, we construct calculable models of direct mediation that solve the mu/Bmu problem and simultaneously lead to realistic phenomenology. The singlet that couples to the Higgs fields develops a runaway produced by soft interactions, then stabilized by a small superpotential perturbation. The mechanism is first realized in an O'Raifeartaigh model of direct gauge mediation with metastable supersymmetry breaking. Focusing then on the microscopic theory, we argue that super QCD with massless and massive flavors in the free magnetic phase gives rise to this dynamics in the infrared. A deformation of the SQCD superpotential leads to large spontaneous R-symmetry breaking, gaugino masses naturally at the scale of the Higgs mass parameters, and absence of CP violating phases.",

        "Authors": "Yuk Tung Liu,Stuart L. Shapiro",
        "Abstract": "Tidal torques acting on a gaseous accretion disk around a binary black hole can create a gap in the disk near the orbital radius. At late times, when the binary inspiral timescale due to gravitational wave emission becomes shorter than the viscous timescale in the disk, the binary decouples from the disk and eventually merges. Prior to decoupling the balance between tidal and viscous torques drives the disk to a quasistationary equilibrium state, perturbed slightly by small amplitude, spiral density waves emanating from the edges of the gap. We consider a black hole binary with a companion of smaller mass and construct a simple Newtonian model for a geometrically thin, Keplerian disk in the orbital plane of the binary. We solve the disk evolution equations in steady state to determine the quasistationary, (orbit-averaged) surface density profile prior to decoupling. We use our solution, which is analytic up to simple quadratures, to compute the electromagnetic flux and approximate radiation spectrum during this epoch. A single nondimensional parameter Td/Tvis, equal to the ratio of the tidal to viscous torque at the orbital radius, determines the disk structure, including the surface density profile, the extent of the gap, the existence of an inner disk, and the accretion rate. The solution reduces to the Shakura-Sunyaev profile for a stationary accretion disk around a single black hole in the limit of small Td/Tvis. Our solution may be useful for choosing physical parameters and setting up quasistationary disk initial data for detailed numerical simulations that begin prior to decoupling and track the subsequent evolution of a black hole binary-disk system.",

        "Abstract": "Long duration Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) originate from the core collapse of massive stars, but the identity of the central engine remains elusive. Previous work has shown that rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized proto-neutron stars (`millisecond proto-magnetars') produce outflows with energies, timescales, and magnetizations sigma_0 (maximum Lorentz factor) that are consistent with those required to produce long GRBs. Here we extend this work in order to construct a self-consistent model that directly connects the properties of the central engine to the observed prompt emission. Just after the launch of the supernova shock, a wind heated by neutrinos is driven from the proto-magnetar. The outflow is collimated into a bipolar jet by its interaction with the star. As the magnetar cools, the wind becomes ultra-relativistic and Poynting-flux dominated (sigma_0 >> 1) on a timescale comparable to that required for the jet to clear a cavity through the star. Although the site and mechanism of the prompt emission are debated, we calculate the emission predicted by two models: magnetic dissipation and internal shocks. Our results favor the magnetic dissipation model in part because it predicts a relatively constant `Band' spectral peak energy E_peak with time during the GRB. The jet baryon loading decreases abruptly when the neutron star becomes transparent to neutrinos at t ~ 10-100 seconds. Jets with ultra-high magnetization cannot effectively accelerate and dissipate their energy, suggesting this transition ends the prompt emission and may explain the steep decay phase that follows. We assess several phenomena potentially related to magnetar birth, including low luminosity GRBs, thermal-rich GRBs/X-ray Flashes, very luminous supernovae, and short duration GRBs with extended emission.",

        "Abstract": "We present a detailed numerical study of the impact that cosmological models featuring a direct interaction between the Dark Energy component that drives the accelerated expansion of the Universe and Cold Dark Matter can have on the linear and nonlinear stages of structure formation. By means of a series of collisionless N-body simulations we study the influence that each of the different effects characterizing these cosmological models - which include among others a fifth force, a time variation of particle masses, and a velocity-dependent acceleration - separately have on the growth of density perturbations and on a series of observable quantities related to linear and nonlinear cosmic structures, as the matter power spectrum, the gravitational bias between baryons and Cold Dark Matter, the halo mass function and the halo density profiles. We perform our analysis applying and comparing different numerical approaches previously adopted in the literature, and we address the partial discrepancies recently claimed in a similar study by Li & Barrow (2010b) with respect to the first outcomes of Baldi et al. (2010), which are found to be related to the specific numerical approach adopted in the former work. Our results fully confirm the conclusions of Baldi et al. (2010) and show that when linear and nonlinear effects of the interaction between Dark Energy and Cold Dark Matter are properly disentangled, the velocity-dependent acceleration is the leading effect acting at nonlinear scales, and in particular is the most important mechanism in lowering the concentration of Cold Dark Matter halos.",

        "Authors": "Masaru Kajisawa,Takashi Ichikawa,Tomohiro Yoshikawa,Toru Yamada,Masato Onodera,Masayuki Akiyama,Ichi Tanaka",
        "Abstract": "We study the evolution of quiescent galaxies at 0.5<z<2.5 as a function of stellar mass, using very deep NIR imaging data taken with the Multi-Object Infrared Camera and Spectrograph on the Subaru Telescope in the GOODS-North region. The deep NIR data allow us to construct a stellar mass-limited sample of quiescent galaxies down to ~10^{10} Msun even at z~2 for the first time. We selected quiescent galaxies with age/tau>6 by performing SED fitting of the multi broad-band photometry from the U to Spitzer 5.8um bands with the population synthesis model of Bruzual & Charlot (2003) where exponentially decaying star formation histories are assumed. The number density of quiescent galaxies increases by a factor of ~3 from 1.0<z<1.5 to 0.5<z<1.0, and by a factor of ~10 from 1.5<z<2.5 to 0.5<z<1.0, while that of star-forming galaxies with age/tau<4 increases only by factors of ~2 and ~3 in the same redshift ranges. At 0.5<z<2.5, the low-mass slope of the stellar mass function of quiescent galaxies is alpha ~ 0 -- 0.6, which is significantly flatter than those of star-forming galaxies (alpha ~ -1.3 -- -1.5). As a result, the fraction of quiescent galaxies in the overall galaxy population increases with stellar mass in the redshift range. The fraction of quiescent galaxies at 10^{11}-10^{11.5} Msun increases from ~20-30% at z~2 to ~40-60% at z~0.75, while that at 10^{10}-10^{10.5} Msun increases from <~ 5% to ~15% in the same redshift range. These results could suggest that the quenching of star formation had been more effective in more massive galaxies at 1<~z<~2. Such a mass-dependent quenching could explain the rapid increase of the number density of ~M* galaxies relative to lower-mass galaxies at z >~ 1-1.5.",

        "Abstract": "We perform 3-D dust radiative transfer (RT) calculations on hydrodynamic simulations of isolated and merging disk galaxies in order to quantitatively study the dependence of observed-frame submillimeter (submm) flux density on galaxy properties. We find that submm flux density and star formation rate (SFR) are related in dramatically different ways for quiescently star-forming galaxies and starbursts. Because the stars formed in the merger-induced starburst do not dominate the bolometric luminosity and the rapid drop in dust mass and more compact geometry cause a sharp increase in dust temperature during the burst, starbursts are very inefficient at boosting submm flux density (e.g., a $\\ga16$x boost in SFR yields a $\\la 2$x boost in submm flux density). Moreover, the ratio of submm flux density to SFR differs significantly between the two modes; thus one cannot assume that the galaxies with highest submm flux density are necessarily those with the highest bolometric luminosity or SFR. These results have important consequences for the bright submillimeter-selected galaxy (SMG) population. Among them are: 1. The SMG population is heterogeneous. In addition to merger-driven starbursts, there is a subpopulation of galaxy pairs, where two disks undergoing a major merger but not yet strongly interacting are blended into one submm source because of the large ($\\ga 15$\", or $\\sim 130$ kpc at $z = 2$) beam of single-dish submm telescopes. 2. SMGs must be very massive ($M_{\\star} \\ga 6 \\times 10^{10} \\msun$). 3. The infall phase makes the SMG duty cycle a factor of a few greater than what is expected for a merger-driven starburst.

        "Authors": "Mark A. Norris,Sheila J. Kannappan",
        "Abstract": "We present the discovery of several Ultra Compact Dwarfs (UCDs) located in field/group environments. Examination of these objects, plus literature objects, confirms the existence of two distinct formation channels for UCDs. We find that the UCDs we have discovered around the group elliptical NGC3923 (and UCDs generally) have properties consistent with their being the most luminous members of the host galaxy's globular cluster (GC) system. We describe UCDs of this type as giant GCs (GGCs). In contrast, the UCD we have found associated with the isolated S0 NGC4546 is clearly the result of the stripping of a nucleated companion galaxy. The young age (~3.4 Gyr) of the UCD, the lack of a correspondingly young GC population, the apparently short dynamical friction decay timescale (~0.5 Gyr) of the UCD, and the presence of a counterrotating gas disc in the host galaxy (co-rotating with the UCD) together suggest that this UCD is the liberated nucleus remaining after the recent stripping of a companion by NGC4546. We suggest a general scheme that unifies the formation of GCs, UCDs, and galaxy nuclei. In this picture \"normal\" GCs are a composite population, composed of GCs formed in situ, GCs acquired from accreted galaxies, and a population of lower mass stripped dwarf nuclei masquerading as GCs. Above a \"scaling onset mass\" of 2x10^6 Msun (Mv ~ -10), UCDs emerge together with a mass-size relation and a likely mass-metallicity relation (the \"blue tilt\"). In the mass range up to 7x10^7 Msun (Mv ~ -13) UCDs comprise a composite population of GGCs and stripped nuclei. Above 7x10^7 Msun, UCDs must be almost exclusively stripped nuclei, as no sufficiently rich GC systems exist to populate such an extreme of the GCLF.",

The pseudo-phase-space density (PPSD) profiles of CDM halos also show remarkable regularity, and are well approximated by simple power laws, Q(r)=\\rho /\\sigma ^3 ~ r^-\\chi . We show that this is expected from dynamical equilibrium considerations, since Jeans' equations predict that the pseudo-phase-space density profiles of Einasto halos should resemble power laws over a wide range of radii. For the values of \\alpha typical of CDM halos, the inner Q profiles of equilibrium halos deviate significantly from a power law only very close to the center, and simulations of extremely high-resolution would be needed to detect such deviations unambiguously. We use an ensemble of halos drawn from the Millennium-II simulation to study which of these two alternatives describe best the mass profile of CDM halos. Our analysis indicates that at the resolution of the best available simulations, both Einasto and power-law PPSD profiles (with adjustable exponents \\alpha and \\chi, respectively) provide equally acceptable fits to the simulations. A full account of the structure of CDM halos requires understanding how the shape parameters that characterize departures from self-similarity, like \\alpha or \\chi, are determined by evolutionary history, environment or initial conditions.",

        "Authors": "C.-A. Faucher-Giguere,D. Keres,C.-P. Ma(UC Berkeley)",
        "Abstract": "We use a suite of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to quantify the accretion rates of baryons into dark matter halos and the resulting baryon mass fractions, as a function of halo mass, redshift, and baryon type (including cold and hot gas). We find that the net baryonic accretion rates through the virial radius are sensitive to galactic outflows and explore a range of outflow parameters to illustrate the effects. We show that the cold gas accretion rate is in general not a simple universal factor of the dark matter accretion rate, and that galactic winds can cause star formation rates to deviate significantly from the external gas accretion rates, both via gas ejection and re-accretion. Furthermore, galactic winds can inject enough energy and momentum in the surrounding medium to slow down accretion altogether, especially in low-mass halos and at low redshift. By resolving the accretion rates versus radius from the halo centers, we show how cold streams penetrate the hot atmospheres of massive halos at z>2, but gradually disappear at lower redshift. The total baryon mass fraction is also strongly suppressed by outflows in low-mass halos, but is nearly universal in the absence of feedback in halos above the UV background suppression scale. The transition halo mass, at which the gas mass in halos is equal for the cold and hot components, is roughly constant at ~10^11.5 Msun and does not depend sensitively on the wind prescription. We provide simple fitting formulae for the cold gas accretion rate into halos in the no-wind case. Finally, we show that cold accretion is broadly consistent with driving the bulk of the highly star-forming galaxies observed at z~2, but that the more intense star formers likely sample the high end of the accretion rate distribution, and may be additionally fueled by a combination of gas recycling, gas re-accretion, hot mode cooling, and mergers.",

        "Abstract": "The hot gas in clusters and groups of galaxies is continuously being enriched with metals from supernovae and stars. It is well established that the enrichment of the gas with elements from oxygen to iron is mainly caused by supernova explosions. The origins of nitrogen and carbon are still being debated. Possible candidates include massive, metal-rich stars, early generations of massive stars, intermediate or low mass stars and Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars. In this paper we accurately determine the metal abundances of the gas in the groups of galaxies NGC 5044 and NGC 5813, and discuss the nature of the objects that create these metals.We mainly focus on carbon and nitrogen. We use spatially-resolved high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy from XMM-Newton. For the spectral fitting, multi-temperature hot gas models are used. The abundance ratios of carbon over oxygen and nitrogen over oxygen that we find are high compared to the ratios in the stars in the disk of our Galaxy. The oxygen and nitrogen abundances we derive are similar to what was found in earlier work on other giant ellipticals in comparable environments. We show that the iron abundances in both our sources have a gradient along the cross-dispersion direction of the Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS). We conclude that it is unlikely that the creation of nitrogen and carbon takes place in massive stars, which end their lives as core-collapse supernovae, enriching the medium with oxygen because oxygen should then also be enhanced. Therefore we favour low-and intermediate mass stars as sources of these elements. The abundances in the hot gas can best be explained by a 30-40% contribution of type Ia supernovae based on the measured oxygen and iron abundances and under the assumption of a Salpeter Initial Mass Function (IMF).",

Such large IR effects can be absorbed into a coordinate change when examining sufficiently local observables, but not when comparing observations at large separation in scales, such as seen by a late-time observer. The analysis is facilitated by definition of a scale-dependent metric and physical momentum. These assist definition of \"IR-safe\" observables seen by a post-inflationary observer, which are contrasted to those based on the local geometry of the reheating surface. For such observables, the observer's horizon provides an effective IR cutoff. IR growth contributes to enhanced statistical inhomogeneities/anisotropies at short scales, observation of which by a present day observer might be sought in 21 cm measurements. Such IR corrections are argued to grow large for a very late-time observer.",

The H-band data come from a variety of sources including our survey of 171 galaxies at the UH 2.2-m, CFHT and UKIRT telescopes, and another 115 galaxies from the Two-Micron All-Sky Survey and GOLDMine archives. The optical data for all 286 Virgo galaxies were extracted from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) images. The H-band and SDSS griz data were analyzed in a homogeneous manner using our own software, yielding a consistent set of deep, multi-band surface brightness profiles for each galaxy. Average surface brightness profiles per morphological bin were created in order to characterize the variety of galaxy light profiles across the Hubble sequence. The 1D bulge-disk decomposition parameters, as well as non-parametric galaxy measures, such as effective radius, effective surface brightness and light concentration, are presented for all 286 galaxies in each of the five optical/near-infrared wavebands. The profile decompositions account for bulge and disk components, spiral arms, nucleus and atmospheric blurring. The Virgo spiral galaxy bulges typically have a Sersic index n ~ 1, while elliptical galaxies prefer n ~ 2. No galaxy spheroid requires n > 3. The light profiles for 70% of the Virgo elliptical galaxies reveal the presence of both a spheroid and disk component. A more in-depth discussion of the structural parameter trends can be found in McDonald et al (2009b). The data provided here should serve as a base for studies of galaxy structure and stellar populations in the cluster environment. The galaxy light profiles and bulge-disk decomposition results are available at the Centre de Donnees astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS;this http URL) and the author's own website (this http URL).",

Scattering of electrons off the fluctuations of the spin density order parameter, \\phi, is strongest at the hot spots; we compute the conductivity due to this scattering in a rainbow approximation. We point out the importance of composite operators, built out of products of the primary electron or $\\phi$ fields: these have important effects also away from the hot spots. The simplest composite operator, \\phi^2, leads to non-Fermi liquid behavior on the entire Fermi surface. We also find an intermediate frequency window in which the cold electrons loose their quasiparticle form due to effectively one-dimensional scattering processes. The latter processes are part of umklapp scattering which leads to singular contributions to the optical conductivity at the lowest frequencies at zero temperature.",

This structure implies that the system can be solved iteratively whenever the individual, uncoupled equations can be solved. We go on to demonstrate the solution of the system for a general warped Calabi-Yau cone: we present an algorithm that yields an explicit Green's function solution for all the supergravity fields, to any desired order, in terms of the harmonic functions on the base of the cone. Our results provide a systematic procedure for obtaining the corrections to a warped throat geometry induced by attachment to a compact bulk.

Our models include cooling, star formation, feedback, and a new stochastic method for tracking the mass recycled back to the interstellar medium from stellar winds and supernovae. We study the influence of merger-induced inflows, enrichment, gas consumption, and galactic winds in determining the nuclear metallicity. The central metallicity is primarily a competition between the inflow of low-metallicity gas and enrichment from star formation. An average depression in the nuclear metallicity of ~0.07 is found for gas-poor disk-disk interactions. Gas-rich disk-disk interactions, on the other hand, typically have an enhancement in the central metallicity that is positively correlated with the gas content. The simulations fare reasonably well when compared to the observed mass-metallicity and separation-metallicity relationships, but further study is warranted.",

        "Abstract": "We make use of interferometric CO and HI observations, and optical integral-field spectroscopy to probe the origin of the molecular and ionised interstellar medium (ISM) in local early-type galaxies (ETGs). We find that 36\\pm5% of our sample of fast rotating ETGs have their ionised gas kinematically misaligned with respect to the stars, setting a strong lower limit on the importance of externally acquired gas (e.g. from mergers and cold accretion). Slow rotators have a flat distribution of misalignments, indicating that the dominant source of gas is external. The molecular, ionised and atomic gas in all the detected galaxies are always kinematically aligned, even when they are misaligned from the stars, suggesting that all these three phases of the ISM share a common origin. In addition, we find that the origin of the cold and warm gas in fast-rotating ETGs is strongly affected by environment, despite the molecular gas detection rate and mass fractions being fairly independent of group/cluster membership. Galaxies in dense groups and the Virgo cluster nearly always have their molecular gas kinematically aligned with the stellar kinematics, consistent with a purely internal origin. In the field, however, kinematic misalignments between the stellar and gaseous components indicate that >46% of local fast-rotating ETGs have their gas supplied from external sources. We discuss several scenarios which could explain the environmental dichotomy, but find it difficult to simultaneously explain the kinematic misalignment difference and the constant detection rate. Furthermore, our results suggest that galaxy mass may be an important independent factor associated with the origin of the gas, with the most massive fast-rotating galaxies in our sample (M_K<-24 mag; stellar mass of >8x10^10 Msun) always having kinematically aligned gas.

        "Authors": "Andrei Khrennikov",
        "Abstract": "This paper discusses a possible resolution of the nonobjectivity-nonlocality dilemma in quantum mechanics in 'the light of experimental tests of the Bell inequality for two entangled photons and a Bell-like inequality for a single neutron. My conclusion is that these experiments show that quantum mechanics is nonobjective: that is, the values of physical observables cannot be assigned to a system before measurement. Bell's assumption of nonlocality has to be rejected as having no direct experimental confirmation, at least thus far. I also consider the relationships between nonobjectivity and contextuality. Specifically, I analyze the impact of the Kochen-Specker theorem on the problem of contextuality of quantum observables. I argue that, just as von Neumann's \"no-go\" theorem, the Kochen-Specker theorem is based on assumptions that do not correspond to the real physical situation. Finally, I present a theory of measurement based on a classical, purely wave model (pre-quantum classical statistical field theory), a model that reproduces quantum probabilities. In this model continuous fields are transformed into discrete clicks of detectors. While this model is classical, it is nonobjective. In this case, nonobjectivity is the result of the dependence of experimental outcomes on the context of measurement, in accordance with Bohr's view.",

        "Authors": "Sergei Gukov,Piotr Su\u0142kowski",
        "Abstract": "Exact solution to many problems in mathematical physics and quantum field theory often can be expressed in terms of an algebraic curve equipped with a meromorphic differential. Typically, the geometry of the curve can be seen most clearly in a suitable semi-classical limit, as $\\hbar \\to 0$, and becomes non-commutative or \"quantum\" away from this limit. For a classical curve defined by the zero locus of a polynomial $A(x,y)$, we provide a construction of its non-commutative counterpart $\\hat{A} (\\hat x, \\hat y)$ using the technique of the topological recursion. This leads to a powerful and systematic algorithm for computing $\\hat{A}$ that, surprisingly, turns out to be much simpler than any of the existent methods. In particular, as a bonus feature of our approach comes a curious observation that, for all curves that come from knots or topological strings, their non-commutative counterparts can be determined just from the first few steps of the topological recursion. We also propose a K-theory criterion for a curve to be \"quantizable,\" and then apply our construction to many examples that come from applications to knots, strings, instantons, and random matrices.",

        "Authors": "Blagoy Rangelov,Andrea H. Prestwich,Rupali Chandar",
        "Abstract": "We present 23 candidate X-ray binaries with luminosities down to 1.8x10^36 erg/s, in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 4449, from observations totaling 105 ksec taken with the ACIS-S instrument on the Chandra Space Telescope. We determine count rates, luminosities, and colors for each source, and perform spectral fits for sources with sufficient counts. We also compile a new catalog of 129 compact star clusters in NGC 4449 from high resolution, multi-band optical images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope, doubling the number of clusters known in this galaxy. The UBVI,Ha luminosities of each cluster are compared with predictions from stellar evolution models to estimate their ages and masses. We find strong evidence for a population of very young massive, black-hole binaries, which comprise nearly 50% of the detected X-ray binaries in NGC 4449. Approximately a third of these remain within their parent star clusters, which formed t < 6-8 Myr ago, while others have likely been ejected from their parent clusters. We also find evidence for a population of somewhat older X-ray binaries, including both supergiant and Be-binaries, which appear to be associated with somewhat older t ~ 100-400 Myr star clusters, and one X-ray binary in an ancient (t ~ 10 Gyr) globular cluster. Our results suggest that detailed information on star clusters can significantly improve constraints on X-ray binary populations in star-forming galaxies.",

        "Authors": "S. X. Hu,B. Militzer,V. N. Goncharov,S. Skupsky",
        "Abstract": "Understanding and designing inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosions through radiation-hydrodynamics simulations rely on the accurate knowledge of the equation of state (EOS) of the deuterium and tritium fuels. To minimize the drive energy for ignition, the imploding shell of DT fuel must be kept as cold as possible. Such low-adiabat ICF implosions can access to coupled and degenerate plasma conditions, in which the analytical or chemical EOS models become inaccurate. Using the path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations we have derived a first-principles EOS (FPEOS) table of deuterium that covers typical ICF fuel conditions at densities ranging from 0.002 to 1596 g/cm3 and temperatures of 1.35 eV to 5.5 keV. We report the internal energy and the pressure, and discuss the structure of the plasma in terms of pair-correlation functions. When compared with the widely used SESAME table and the revised Kerley03 table, discrepancies in the internal energy and in the pressure are identified for moderately coupled and degenerate plasma conditions. In contrast to the SESAME table, the revised Kerley03 table is in better agreement with our FPEOS results over a wide range of densities and temperatures. Although subtle differences still exist for lower temperatures (T < 10 eV) and moderate densities (1 to 10 g/cc), hydrodynamics simulations of cryogenic ICF implosions using the FPEOS table and the Kerley03 table have resulted in similar results for the peak density, areal density ({\\rho}R), and neutron yield, which are significantly different from the SESAME simulations.",

        "Authors": "Matthias Stute(1),Jose Gracia(2) ((1) Eberhard Karls Universitaet Tuebingen, Germany, (2) High Performance Computing Center Stuttgart, Germany)",
        "Abstract": "Analytical radially self-similar models are the best available solutions describing disk-winds but need several improvements. In a previous article, we introduced models of jets from truncated disks, i.e. evolved in time numerical simulations based on a radially self-similar MHD solution but including the effects of a finite radius of the jet-emitting disk and thus the outflow. In paper I of this series, we compared these models with available observational data varying the jet density and velocity, the mass of the protostar and the radius of the aforementioned truncation. In paper I, we assumed that the jet lies in the plane of the sky. In this paper, we investigate the effect of different inclinations of the jet. In order to compare our models with observed jet widths inferred from recent optical images taken with HST and AO, we create again emission maps in different forbidden lines and from such emission maps, we determine the jet width as the full-width half-maximum of the emission. We can reproduce the jet width of DG Tau and its variations very well and the derived inclination of 40$^\\circ$ is in excellent agreement with literature values of 32--52$^\\circ$. In CW Tau we overestimate the inclination in our best-fit model. In the other objects, we cannot find appropriate models which reproduce the variations of the observed jet widths, only the average jet width itself is well modeled as in paper I. We conclude that truncation -- i.e. taking into account the finite radius of the jet launching region -- is necessary to reproduce the observed jet widths and our simulations limit the possible range of truncation radii. The effects of inclination are important for modeling the intrinsic variations seen in observed jet widths. Our models can be used to infer independently the inclinations in the observed sample, however, a parameter study with a finer grid of parameters is needed.",

        "Abstract": "We present the results of a multiplicity survey of 212 T Tauri stars in the Chamaeleon I and Taurus-Auriga star-forming regions, based on high-resolution spectra from the Magellan Clay 6.5 m telescope. From these data, we achieved a typical radial velocity precision of ~80 m/s with slower rotators yielding better precision, in general. For 174 of these stars, we obtained multi-epoch data with sufficient time baselines to identify binaries based on radial velocity variations. We identified eight close binaries and four close triples, of which three and two, respectively, are new discoveries. The spectroscopic multiplicity fractions we find for Cha I (7%) and Tau-Aur (6%) are similar to each other, and to the results of field star surveys in the same mass and period regime. However, unlike the results from imaging surveys, the frequency of systems with close companions in our sample is not seen to depend on primary mass. Additionally, we do not find a strong correlation between accretion and close multiplicity. This implies that close companions are not likely the main source of the accretion shut down observed in weak-lined T Tauri stars. Our results also suggest that sufficient radial velocity precision can be achieved for at least a subset of slowly rotating young stars to search for hot Jupiter planets.",

The experiment involves a surface detector (SD) array and three fluorescence detector (FD) stations. FD stations, installed surrounding the SD array, measure the air fluorescence light emitted from extensive air showers (EASs) for precise determination of their energies and species. The detectors employed at one of the three FD stations were relocated from the High Resolution Fly's Eye experiment. At the other two stations, newly designed detectors were constructed for the TA experiment. An FD consists of a primary mirror and a camera equipped with photomultiplier tubes. To obtain the EAS parameters with high accuracies, understanding the FD optical characteristics is important. In this paper, we report the characteristics and installation of new FDs and the performances of the FD components. The results of the monitored mirror reflectance during the observation time are also described in this report.",

It is shown that the model allows to describe any values of the bond stiffnesses exactly. Two different calibration procedures depending on bond length/thickness ratio are proposed. It is shown that parameters of model can be chosen so that under small deformations the bond is equivalent to either Bernoulli-Euler rod or Timoshenko rod or short cylinder connecting particles. Simple expressions, connecting parameters of V-model with geometrical and mechanical characteristics of the bond, are derived.

        "Authors": "Jean Vall\u00e8s(LMA-PAU)",
        "Abstract": "In the town of Saratov where he was prisonner, Poncelet, continuing the work of Euler and Steiner on polygons simultaneously inscribed in a circle and circumscribed around an other circle, proved the following generalization : \"Let C and D be two smooth conics in the projective complex plane. If D passes through the n(n-1)/2 vertices of a complete polygon with n sides tangent to C then D passes through the vertices of infinitely many such polygons.\" According to Marcel Berger this theorem is the nicest result about the geometry of conics. Even if it is, there are few proofs of it. To my knowledge there are only three. The first proof, published in 1822 and based on infinitesimal deformations, is due to Poncelet. Later, Jacobi proposed a new proof based on finite order points on elliptic curves; his proof, certainly the most famous, is explained in a modern way and in detail by Griffiths and Harris. In 1870 Weyr proved a Poncelet theorem in space (more precisely for two quadrics) that implies the one above when one quadric is a cone; this proof is explained by Barth and Bauer. Our aim in this short note is to involve vector bundles techniques to propose a new proof of this celebrated result. Poncelet did not appreciate Jacobi's for the reason that it was too far from the geometric intuition. I guess that he would not appreciate our proof either for the same reason.",

These are derived from images and values in the literature and from new H\\alpha{} images for 72 galaxies which we publish here. We describe the sample, observations and procedures to extract the H\\alpha{} fluxes and related quantities. We discuss the SFR properties of our sample and confirm the well-known correlation with galaxy luminosity, albeit with high dispersion. Our SFRs range from 0.1 to 11 Msun yr-1 with a median SFR value for the complete sample of 0.2 Msun yr-1. This median values is somewhat lower than similar published measurements, which we attribute, in part, to our sample being HI-selected and, thus, not biased towards high SFRs as has frequently been the case in previous studies. Additionally, we calculate internal absorptions for the H\\alpha{} line, A(H\\alpha{}), which are lower than many of those used in previous studies. Our derived EWs, which range from 1 to 880\u00c5 with a median value of 27\u00c5, show little dependence with luminosity but rise by a factor of five from early- to late-type galaxies. This paper is the first in a series aimed at comparing SFRs obtained from H\\alpha{} imaging of galaxies with information derived from other tracers of star formation and atomic and molecular gas.",

A general overview of the spacecraft is followed by a more detailed look at the optical design, both as intended and as built. Basic characteristics of the complete complement of science instruments are also summarized. Experience with the telescope on-orbit is reviewed, starting with the major initial problems, solutions, human servicing missions, and the associated expansion of the observatory's capabilities over this time. Specific attention is then given to understanding Hubble's optical quality and pointing/jitter performance, two fundamental characteristics of a telescope. Experience with-and the important mitigation of-radiation damage and contamination is also related. Beyond the telescope itself, the advances in data reduction, calibration, and observing techniques are briefly discussed, as well as the subsequent emergence of highly accessible high-level archival science products. Hubble's scientific impact concludes the discussion.",

        "Abstract": "The central collision between two solid spheres or the normal collision between a sphere and a plate are important to understand in detail before studying more complex particle interactions. Models exist to describe this basic problem but are not always consistent with available experiments. An interesting benchmark to compare models and experiments is the relation between the normal coefficient of restitution e and the incident velocity v. In order to draw a broad comparison between experiments and models (Krijt, S., G\u00fcttler, C., Hei\u00dfelmann, D., Tielens, A.G.G.M., Dominik, C., Energy dissipation in head-on collisions of spheres, submitted), we provide in this article an overview on the literature describing experiments on normal collisions, preferably providing data on e(v). We will briefly summarize our expectation on this relation according to an established collision model in order to classify these experiments. We will then provide an overview on experimental techniques, which we found in the summarized articles, as well as a listing of all experiments along with a description of the main features of these. The raw data on e(v) of the listed experiments were digitized and are provided with this article.",

        "Authors": "S.G. Chefranov",
        "Abstract": "It is proposed the new microscopic theory of Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation (VCR), emitted directly by medium in non-equilibrium state, arising due to the interaction of medium with a sufficiently fast charged particle. Contrary to the macroscopic VCR theory of Tamm-Frank and quantum VCR theory of Ginzburg, we establish the new VCR parametric resonance mechanism and the new threshold of VCR effect, which is better corresponding to the VCR observations. We show that counting of the, known from Abraham's electrodynamics, force density F_A=0.5rot[PE] (P is the polarization vector of the medium in locally non-equilibrium anisotropic state, arising due to the non-stationary electric field E of particle, moving with the constant speed v) defines the possibility of parametric resonance excitation of the transversal to E polarization waves P. We get that the condition of exponential growth with time of the amplitude of the wave P, providing the realization of VCR effect, is |v|>v_th=c/n_*, where c is the light speed in vacuum, (n_*)>n>1, and n_* is the refraction index of the isotropic medium in the equilibrium state.",

We consider walls of the box to have dynamic and introduce the time evolution of the quantized field by expanding it over the 'instantaneous basis'. We explain how we can obtain the average number of particles created. In this regard we find the Bogliubove coefficients. We consider an oscillation and determine the coupling conditions between different modes that can be satisfied depending on the cavity's spectrum. Assuming the parametric resonance case we obtain an expression for the mean number of created fermions in each mode of an oscillation and their dynamical Casimir energy.",

Nowadays indium tin oxide (ITO) is the most wide spread transparent conductor in optoelectronic applications, however the mechanical rigidity of this material limits its use for future flexible devices. Here we report novel transparent conductors based on few layer graphene (FLG) intercalated with ferric chloride (FeCl3) with an outstandingly high electrical conductivity and optical transparency. We show that upon intercalation a record low sheet resistance of 8.8 Ohm/square is attained together with an optical transmittance higher than 84% in the visible range. These parameters outperform the best values of ITO and of other carbon-based materials, making these novel transparent conductors the best candidates for future flexible optoelectronics.",

        "Authors": "Romain Nguyen van yen,Dmitry Kolomenskiy,Kai Schneider",
        "Abstract": "We report the results of a detailed study of the spectral properties of Laplace and Stokes operators, modified with a volume penalization term designed to approximate Dirichlet conditions in the limit when a penalization parameter, $\\eta$, tends to zero. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are determined either analytically or numerically as functions of $\\eta$, both in the continuous case and after applying Fourier or finite difference discretization schemes. For fixed $\\eta$, we find that only the part of the spectrum corresponding to eigenvalues $\\lambda \\lesssim \\eta^{-1}$ approaches Dirichlet boundary conditions, while the remainder of the spectrum is made of uncontrolled, spurious wall modes. The penalization error for the controlled eigenfunctions is estimated as a function of $\\eta$ and $\\lambda$. Surprisingly, in the Stokes case, we show that the eigenfunctions approximately satisfy, with a precision $O(\\eta)$, Navier slip boundary conditions with slip length equal to $\\sqrt{\\eta}$. Moreover, for a given discretization, we show that there exists a value of $\\eta$, corresponding to a balance between penalization and discretization errors, below which no further gain in precision is achieved. These results shed light on the behavior of volume penalization schemes when solving the Navier-Stokes equations, outline the limitations of the method, and give indications on how to choose the penalization parameter in practical cases.",

        "Abstract": "This paper is to introduce a new software called CBwaves which provides a fast and accurate computational tool to determine the gravitational waveforms yielded by generic spinning binaries of neutron stars and/or black holes on eccentric orbits. This is done within the post-Newtonian (PN) framework by integrating the equations of motion and the spin precession equations while the radiation field is determined by a simultaneous evaluation of the analytic waveforms. In applying CBwaves various physically interesting scenarios have been investigated. In particular, we have studied the appropriateness of the adiabatic approximation, and justified that the energy balance relation is indeed insensitive to the specific form of the applied radiation reaction term. By studying eccentric binary systems it is demonstrated that circular template banks are very ineffective in identifying binaries even if they possess tiny residual orbital eccentricity. In addition, by investigating the validity of the energy balance relation we show that, on contrary to the general expectations, the post-Newtonian approximation should not be applied once the post-Newtonian parameter gets beyond the critical value $\\sim 0.08-0.1$. Finally, by studying the early phase of the gravitational waves emitted by strongly eccentric binary systems---which could be formed e.g. in various many-body interactions in the galactic halo---we have found that they possess very specific characteristics which may be used to identify these type of binary systems.",

        "Abstract": "We present an optical group catalog between 0.1 < z < 1 based on 16,500 high-quality spectroscopic redshifts in the completed zCOSMOS-bright survey. The catalog published herein contains 1498 groups in total and 192 groups with more than five observed members. The catalog includes both group properties and the identification of the member galaxies. Based on mock catalogs, the completeness and purity of groups with three and more members should be both about 83% with respect to all groups that should have been detectable within the survey, and more than 75% of the groups should exhibit a one-to-one correspondence to the \"real\" groups. Particularly at high redshift, there are apparently more galaxies in groups in the COSMOS field than expected from mock catalogs. We detect clear evidence for the growth of cosmic structure over the last seven billion years in the sense that the fraction of galaxies that are found in groups (in volume-limited samples) increases significantly with cosmic time. In the second part of the paper, we develop a method for associating galaxies that only have photo-z to our spectroscopically identified groups. We show that this leads to improved definition of group centers, improved identification of the most massive galaxies in the groups, and improved identification of central and satellite galaxies, where we define the former to be galaxies at the minimum of the gravitational potential wells. Subsamples of centrals and satellites in the groups can be defined with purities up to 80%, while a straight binary classification of all group and non-group galaxies into centrals and satellites achieves purities of 85% and 75%, respectively, for the spectroscopic sample.",

In a second modeling approach, we deal with the backaction of the magnetization dynamics on the elastic wave by solving the elastic wave equation and the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation selfconsistently, obtaining analytical solutions for the acoustic wave phase shift and attenuation. We compare both modeling approaches with the complex forward transmission of a LiNbO$_3$/Ni surface acoustic wave hybrid device recorded experimentally as a function of the external magnetic field orientation and magnitude, rotating the field within three different planes and employing three different surface acoustic wave frequencies. We find quantitative agreement of the experimentally observed power absorption and surface acoustic wave phase shift with our modeling predictions using one set of parameters for all field configurations and frequencies.",

We describe a parameter study of galaxy formation simulations of an L* galaxy that uses early stellar feedback combined with supernova feedback to match the stellar mass--halo mass relationship. While supernova feedback alone can reduce star formation enough to match the stellar mass--halo mass relationship, the galaxy forms too many stars before z=2 to match the evolution seen using abundance matching. Our early stellar feedback is purely thermal and thus operates like a UV ionization source as well as providing some additional pressure from the radiation of massive, young stars. The early feedback heats gas to >10^6 K before cooling to 10^4 K. The pressure from this hot gas creates a more extended disk and prevents more star formation prior to z=1 than supernovae feedback alone. The resulting disk galaxy has a flat rotation curve, an exponential surface brightness profile, and matches a wide range of disk scaling relationships. The disk forms from the inside-out with an increasing exponential scale length as the galaxy evolves. Overall, early stellar feedback helps to simulate galaxies that match observational results at low and high redshifts.",

Our approach is based on the concentration inequality of integral operator and the theory of matrix perturbation. Our analysis shows that when there is a large eigengap, we can improve the approximation error of the Nystr\u00f6m method from $O(N/m^{1/4})$ to $O(N/m^{1/2})$ when measured in Frobenius norm, where $N$ is the size of the kernel matrix, and $m$ is the number of sampled columns.",

        "Abstract": "Optical dispersion spectra at energies up to 30 eV play a vital role in understanding the chirality-dependent van der Waals London dispersion interactions of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). We use one-electron theory based calculations to obtain the band structures and the frequency dependent dielectric response function from 0-30 eV for 64 SWCNTs differing in radius, electronic structure classification, and geometry. The resulting optical dispersion properties can be categorized over three distinct energy intervals (M, pi, and sigma, respectively representing 0-0.1, 0.1-5, and 5-30 eV regions) and over radii above or below the zone-folding limit of 0.7 nm. While pi peaks vary systematically with radius for a given electronic structure type, peaks are independent of tube radius above the zone folding limit and depend entirely on SWCNT geometry. Based on these calculated one-electron dielectric response functions we compute and review Van derWaals - London dispersion spectra, full spectral Hamaker coefficients, and van derWaals - London dispersion interaction energies for all calculated frequency dependent dielectric response functions. Our results are categorized using a new optical dielectric function classification scheme that groups the nanotubes according to observable trends and notable features (e.g. the metal paradox) in the 0-30 eV part of the optical dispersion spectra. While the trends in these spectra begin to break down at the zone folding diameter limit, the trends in the related van derWaals - London dispersion spectra tend to remain stable all the way down to the smallest single wall carbon nanotubes in a given class.",

        "Abstract": "It has been recently suggested that possible effects of Chern-Simons gravity on a quantum interferometer are dependent on the latitude and direction of the interferometer on Earth in orbital motion around Sun. Continuing work initiated in the earlier publication [Okawara, Yamada and Asada, Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 231101 (2012)], we perform numerical calculations of time variation in the induced phase shifts for nonequatorial cases. We show that the maximum phase shift at any latitude might occur at 6, 0 (and 12), and 18 hours (in local time) of each day, when the normal vector to the interferometer is vertical, eastbound and northbound, respectively. If two identical interferometers were located at different latitudes, the difference between two phase shifts that are measured at the same local time would be $O(\\sin \\delta\\varphi)$ for a small latitude difference $\\delta\\varphi$. It might thus become maximally $\\sim 20$ percents for $\\delta\\varphi \\sim 10$ degrees, for instance.",

        "Authors": "Feng Yan,Philippe Martins,Laurent Decreusefond",
        "Abstract": "Homology theory has attracted great attention because it can provide novel and powerful solutions to address coverage problems in wireless sensor networks. They usually use an easily computable algebraic object, Rips complex, to detect coverage holes. But Rips complex may miss some coverage holes in some cases. In this paper, we investigate homology-based coverage hole detection for wireless sensor networks on sphere. The situations when Rips complex may miss coverage holes are first presented. Then we choose the proportion of the area of coverage holes missed by Rips complex as a metric to evaluate the accuracy of homology-based coverage hole detection approaches. Three different cases are considered for the computation of accuracy. For each case, closed-form expressions for lower and upper bounds of the accuracy are derived. Simulation results are well consistent with the analytical lower and upper bounds, with maximum differences of 0.5% and 3% respectively. Furthermore, it is shown that the radius of sphere has little impact on the accuracy if it is much larger than communication and sensing radii of each sensor.",

In more recent papers \\cite{StojnicCSetamBlock09,StojnicICASSP09block,StojnicJSTSP09} we considered under-determined systems with the so-called \\textbf{block}-sparse solutions. In a large dimensional and statistical context in \\cite{StojnicCSetamBlock09} we determined lower bounds on the values of allowable sparsity for any given number (proportional to the length of the unknown vector) of equations such that an $\\ell_2/\\ell_1$-optimization algorithm succeeds in solving the system. These lower bounds happened to be in a solid numerical agreement with what one can observe through numerical experiments. Here we derive the corresponding upper bounds.

        "Abstract": "Solving under-determined systems of linear equations with sparse solutions attracted enormous amount of attention in recent years, above all, due to work of \\cite{CRT,CanRomTao06,DonohoPol}. In \\cite{CRT,CanRomTao06,DonohoPol} it was rigorously shown for the first time that in a statistical and large dimensional context a linear sparsity can be recovered from an under-determined system via a simple polynomial $\\ell_1$-optimization algorithm. \\cite{CanRomTao06} went even further and established that in \\emph{noisy} systems for any linear level of under-determinedness there is again a linear sparsity that can be \\emph{approximately} recovered through an SOCP (second order cone programming) noisy equivalent to $\\ell_1$. Moreover, the approximate solution is (in an $\\ell_2$-norm sense) guaranteed to be no further from the sparse unknown vector than a constant times the noise. In this paper we will also consider solving \\emph{noisy} linear systems and present an alternative statistical framework that can be used for their analysis. To demonstrate how the framework works we will show how one can use it to precisely characterize the approximation error of a wide class of SOCP algorithms. We will also show that our theoretical predictions are in a solid agrement with the results one can get through numerical simulations.",

        "Authors": "Baradhwaj Coleppa,Felix Kling,Shufang Su",
        "Abstract": "We study the implication of the LHC Higgs search results on the Type II Two Higgs-Doublet Model. In particular, we explore the scenarios in which the observed 126 GeV Higgs signal is interpreted as either the light CP-even Higgs $h^0$ or the heavy CP-even Higgs $H^0$. Imposing both theoretical and experimental constraints, we analyze the surviving parameter regions in $m_H$ ($m_h$), $m_A$, $m_{H^\\pm}$, $\\tan\\beta$ and $\\sin(\\beta - \\alpha)$. We further identify the regions that could accommodate a 126 GeV Higgs with cross sections consistent with the observed Higgs signal. We find that in the $h^0$-126 case, we are restricted to narrow regions of $\\sin(\\beta-\\alpha) \\approx \\pm 1$ with $\\tan\\beta$ up to 4, or an extended region with $0.55 < \\sin(\\beta-\\alpha) < 0.9$ and $1.5 < \\tan\\beta < 4$. The values of $m_H$, $m_A$ and $m_{H^\\pm}$, however, are relatively unconstrained. In the $H^0$-126 case, we are restricted to a narrow region of $\\sin(\\beta-\\alpha) \\sim 0$ with $\\tan\\beta$ up to about 8, or an extended region of $\\sin(\\beta-\\alpha) $ between $-0.8$ to $-0.05$, with $\\tan\\beta$ extended to 30 or higher. $m_A$ and $m_{H^\\pm}$ are nearly degenerate due to $\\Delta\\rho$ constraints. Imposing flavor constraints shrinks the surviving parameter space significantly for the $H^0$-126 case, limiting $\\tan\\beta \\lesssim 10$, but has little effect in the $h^0$-126 case. We also investigate the correlation between $\\gamma\\gamma$, $VV$ and $bb/\\tau\\tau$ channels. $\\gamma\\gamma$ and $VV$ channels are most likely to be highly correlated with $\\gamma\\gamma:VV \\sim 1$ for the normalized cross sections.",

We show that these rings are isomorphic to the rings of quasi modular forms for threefolds with duality groups for which these are known. For the other cases, they provide generalizations thereof. We furthermore study an involution which acts on the quasi modular forms. We interpret it as a duality which exchanges two distinguished expansion loci of the topological string amplitudes in the moduli space. We construct these special polynomial rings and match them with known quasi modular forms for non-compact Calabi-Yau geometries and their mirrors including local P^2 and local del Pezzo geometries with E_5,E_6,E_7 and E_8 type singularities.

        "Authors": "Santanu Das,Tarun Souradeep",
        "Abstract": "A number of studies of WMAP and Planck have highlighted that the power at the low multipoles in CMB power spectrum are lower than their theoretically predicted values. Possible angular correlation between the orientations of these low multipoles have also been claimed. It is important to investigate the possibility that the power deficiency at low multipoles may not be of primordial origin and is only an observation artifact coming from the scan procedure adapted in the WMAP or Planck satellites. Therefore, its always important to investigate all the observational artifacts that can mimic them. The CMB dipole which is almost 550 times higher than the quadrupole can leak to the higher multipoles due to the non-symmetric beam shape of the WMAP. In this paper a formalism has been developed and simulations are carried out to study the effect of the non-symmetric beam on this power transfer. It is interesting to observed that a small but non-negligible amount of power from the dipole can get transferred to the quadrupole and the higher multipoles due to the non-symmetric beam. It is shown that in case of WMAP scan strategy the shape of the quadrupole coming due to this power leakage is very much similar to the observed quadrupole from WMAP data. Simulations have also been carried out for Planck scan strategy. It is seen that for Planck scan strategy the power transfer is not only limited to the quadrupole but also to a few higher low multipoles. Since the actual beam shapes of Planck are not publicly available we present results in terms of upper limits on asymmetric beam parameters that would contaminate of the quadrupole power at the level of $1\\mu K$.",

The distinguishing aspect of the situation at hand is that an unreliable data-rate limited network is placed between controller and the plant input. To achieve robustness with respect to dropouts, the controller transmits data packets containing plant input predictions, which minimize a finite horizon cost function. In our formulation, we design sparse packets for rate-limited networks, by adopting an an ell-0 optimization, which can be effectively solved by an orthogonal matching pursuit method. Our formulation ensures asymptotic stability of the control loop in the presence of bounded packet dropouts. Simulation results indicate that the proposed controller provides sparse control packets, thereby giving bit-rate reductions for the case of memoryless scalar coding schemes when compared to the use of, more common, quadratic cost functions, as in linear quadratic (LQ) control.",

However, the conventional Lambertian limit is only valid for idealized material systems with weak absorption, and cannot hold for the typical semiconductor materials used in solar cells due to the substantial absorption of these materials. Herein we theoretically demonstrate the maximal solar absorption enhancement for semiconductor materials and elucidate the general design principle for light trapping structures to approach the theoretical maximum. By following the principles, we design a practical light trapping structure that can enable an ultrathin layer of semiconductor materials,for instance, 10 nm thick a-Si, absorb > 90% sunlight above the bandgap. The design has active materials with one order of magnitude less volume than any of the existing solar light trapping designs in literature. This work points towards the development of ultimate solar light trapping techniques.",

To answer such questions, we generalize the definition of marginal utility of a good to define the marginal utility of a parameter vector specifying a game. So rather than analyze the global structure of the relationship between a game's parameter vector and player behavior, as in previous work, we focus on the local structure of that relationship. This allows us to prove that generically, every game can have negative marginal value of information, unless one imposes a priori constraints on allowed changes to the game's parameter vector. We demonstrate these and related results numerically, and discuss their implications.",

The classification feasibility is ensured by the use of isozymes as genetic markers allowing the identification of all three phenotypic classes in the progeny of individual heterozygous diploid plant and is based on different phenotypic class ratios in the progenies obtained by meiotic and mitotic agamospermy. The data indicate that for sugar beet meiotic agamospermy is the more typical since 13 of 15 explored progenies were classified as those produced by meiotic agamospermy and only 2 as produced by mitotic agamospermy.",

        "Abstract": "The spin-1/2 J1-J2 antiferromagnet is a prototypical model for frustrated magnetism and one possible candidate for a realization of a spin liquid phase. The generalization of this system on the anisotropic square lattice is given by the J1-J2-J1'-J2' Heisenberg model, which can be treated by a renormalization group (RG) analysis of coupled frustrated chains. The J1-J2-J1'-J2'-model shows an interesting interplay of N\u00e9el order, dimerization, and spin liquid behavior. The analytical findings supported by numerical results indicate that for the isotropic model the phase at intermediate coupling strength 0.4 J1 < J2 < 0.6 J1 is not a spin liquid, but has instead a spontaneously staggered dimer order.",

        "Abstract": "Disc-winds originating from the inner parts of accretion discs are considered as the basic component of magnetically collimated outflows. The only available analytical MHD solutions to describe disc-driven jets are those characterized by the symmetry of radial self-similarity. However, radially self-similar MHD jet models, in general, have three geometrical shortcomings, (i) a singularity at the jet axis, (ii) the necessary assumption of axisymmetry, and (iii) the non-existence of an intrinsic radial scale, i.e. the jets formally extend to radial infinity. Hence, numerical simulations are necessary to extend the analytical solutions towards the axis, by solving the full three-dimensional equations of MHD and impose a termination radius at finite radial distance. We focus here on studying the effects of relaxing the (ii) assumption of axisymmetry, i.e. of performing full 3D numerical simulations of a disc-wind crossing all magnetohydrodynamic critical surfaces. We compare the results of these runs with previous axisymmetric 2.5D simulations. The structure of the flow in all simulations shows strong similarities. The 3D runs reach a steady state and stay close to axisymmetry for most of the physical quantities, except for the poloidal magnetic field and the toroidal velocity which slightly deviate from axisymmetry. The latter quantities show signs of instabilities, which, however, are confined to the region inside the fast magnetosonic separatrix surface. The forces present in the flow, both of collimating and accelerating nature, are in good agreement in both the 2.5D and the 3D runs. We conclude that the analytical solution behaves well also after relaxing the basic assumption of axisymmetry.",

        "Abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) emerge as underlying infrastructures for new classes of large scale net- worked embedded systems. However, WSNs system designers must fulfill the Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements imposed by the applications (and users). Very harsh and dynamic physical environments and extremely limited energy/computing/memory/communication node resources are major obstacles for satisfying QoS metrics such as reliability, timeliness and system lifetime. The limited communication range of WSN nodes, link asymmetry and the characteristics of the physical environment lead to a major source of QoS degradation in WSNs. This paper proposes a Link Reliability based Two-Hop Routing protocol for wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The protocol achieves to reduce packet deadline miss ratio while consid- ering link reliability, two-hop velocity and power efficiency and utilizes memory and computational effective methods for estimating the link metrics. Numerical results provide insights that the protocol has a lower packet deadline miss ratio and longer sensor network lifetime. The results show that the proposed protocol is a feasible solution to the QoS routing problem in wireless sensor networks that support real-time applications.",

        "Authors": "Aleksey Generozov,Zoltan Haiman",
        "Abstract": "We propose a new spectral signature for supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) with circumbinary gas disks: a sharp drop in flux blueward of the Lyman limit. A prominent edge is produced if the gas dominating the emission in the Lyman continuum region of the spectrum is sufficiently cold (T < 20,000 K) to contain significant neutral hydrogen. Circumbinary disks may be in this regime if the binary torques open a central cavity in the disk and clear most of the hot gas from the inner region, and if any residual UV emission from the individual BHs is either dim or intermittent. We model the vertical structure and spectra of circumbinary disks using the radiative transfer code TLUSTY, and identify the range of BH masses and binary separations producing a Lyman edge. We find that compact supermassive binaries with orbital periods of ~0.1 - 10 yr, whose gravitational waves (GWs) are expected to be detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), could have prominent Lyman edges. Such strong spectral edge features are not typically present in AGN spectra and could serve as corroborating evidence for the presence of a SMBHB.",

We first find the real-space Hamiltonian of the nonlocal-coupling system of the 1DW and SOC, and then derive out an equation determining the energy of the hybridization state between the 1DW and SOC modes and an analytic formula for the single-photon transmission. Through them, we recognize that the single-photon transmission-dip position can be changed by adjusting the SOC size and the coupling strength between the 1DW and SOC. The transmission spectra strongly depends on the nonlocal-coupling function between the 1DW and SOC, and holds an asymmetry line shape. At last, we simulate the asymmetry of the single-photon transmission by a gold-based waveguide coupled with a rectangular SOC.",

The best features that can be used at present to distinguish TZOs from the general RSG population are the unusually strong heavy-element and Li lines present in their spectra, products of the star's fully convective envelope linking the photosphere with the extraordinarily hot burning region in the vicinity of the neutron star core. Here we present our discovery of a TZO candidate in the Small Magellanic Cloud. It is the first star to display the distinctive chemical profile of anomalous element enhancements thought to be unique to TZOs. The positive detection of a TZO will provide the first direct evidence for a completely new model of stellar interiors, a theoretically predicted fate for massive binary systems, and never-before-seen nucleosynthesis processes that would offer a new channel for Li and heavy-element production in our universe.",

        "Abstract": "We present the first spectroscopic confirmation of an ultra-massive galaxy at redshift z>3 using data from Keck-NIRSPEC, VLT-Xshooter, and GTC-Osiris. We detect strong [OIII] and Ly$\\alpha$ emission, and weak [OII], CIV, and HeII, placing C1-23152 at a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{spec}$=3.351. The modeling of the emission-line corrected spectral energy distribution results in a best-fit stellar mass of $M_{*}=3.1^{+0.6}_{-0.7}\\times10^{11} M_{\\odot}$, a star-formation rate of <7 $M_{\\odot} yr^{-1}$, and negligible dust extinction. The stars appear to have formed in a short intense burst ~300-500 Myr prior to the observation epoch, setting the formation redshift of this galaxy at z~4.1. From the analysis of the line ratios and widths, and the observed flux at 24$\\mu$m, we confirm the presence of a luminous hidden active galactic nucleus (AGN), with bolometric luminosity of ~$10^{46}erg s^{-1}$. Potential contamination to the observed SED from the AGN continuum is constrained, placing a lower limit on the stellar mass of $2\\times10^{11} M_{\\odot}$. HST/WFC3 $H_{160}$ and ACS $I_{814}$ images are modeled, resulting in an effective radius of $r_{e}$~1 kpc in the $H_{160}$ band and a Sersic index n~4.4. This object may be a prototype of the progenitors of local most massive elliptical galaxies in the first 2 Gyr of cosmic history, having formed most of its stars at z>4 in a highly dissipative, intense, and short burst of star formation. C1-23152 is completing its transition to a post-starburst phase while hosting a powerful AGN, potentially responsible for the quenching of the star formation activity.",

This immunization performs superiorly to some other previously known strategies. Our work points out a new direction in immunization of seasonal epidemics.",

        "Abstract": "While studies of gas-phase metallicity gradients in disc galaxies are common, very little has been done in the acquisition of stellar abundance gradients in the same regions. We present here a comparative study of the stellar metallicity and age distributions in a sample of 62 nearly face-on, spiral galaxies with and without bars, using data from the CALIFA survey. We measure the slopes of the gradients and study their relation with other properties of the galaxies. We find that the mean stellar age and metallicity gradients in the disc are shallow and negative. Furthermore, when normalized to the effective radius of the disc, the slope of the stellar population gradients does not correlate with the mass or with the morphological type of the galaxies. Contrary to this, the values of both age and metallicity at $\\sim$2.5 scale-lengths correlate with the central velocity dispersion in a similar manner to the central values of the bulges, although bulges show, on average, older ages and higher metallicities than the discs. One of the goals of the present paper is to test the theoretical prediction that non-linear coupling between the bar and the spiral arms is an efficient mechanism for producing radial migrations across significant distances within discs. The process of radial migration should flatten the stellar metallicity gradient with time and, therefore, we would expect flatter stellar metallicity gradients in barred galaxies. However, we do not find any difference in the metallicity or age gradients in galaxies with without bars. We discuss possible scenarios that can lead to this absence of difference.",

        "Abstract": "The very long and thin infrared dark cloud \"Nessie\" is even longer than had been previously claimed, and an analysis of its Galactic location suggests that it lies directly in the Milky Way's mid-plane, tracing out a highly elongated bone-like feature within the prominent Scutum-Centaurus spiral arm. Re-analysis of mid-infrared imagery from the Spitzer Space Telescope shows that this IRDC is at least 2, and possibly as many as 5 times longer than had originally been claimed by Nessie's discoverers (Jackson et al. 2010); its aspect ratio is therefore at least 300:1, and possibly as large as 800:1. A careful accounting for both the Sun's offset from the Galactic plane ($\\sim 25$ pc) and the Galactic center's offset from the $(l^{II},b^{II})=(0,0)$ position shows that the latitude of the true Galactic mid-plane at the 3.1 kpc distance to the Scutum-Centaurus Arm is not $b=0$, but instead closer to $b=-0.4$, which is the latitude of Nessie to within a few pc. An analysis of the radial velocities of low-density (CO) and high-density (${\\rm NH}_3$) gas associated with the Nessie dust feature suggests that Nessie runs along the Scutum-Centaurus Arm in position-position-velocity space, which means it likely forms a dense `spine' of the arm in real space as well. The Scutum-Centaurus arm is the closest major spiral arm to the Sun toward the inner Galaxy, and, at the longitude of Nessie, it is almost perpendicular to our line of sight, making Nessie the easiest feature to see as a shadow elongated along the Galactic Plane from our location. Future high-resolution dust mapping and molecular line observations of the harder-to-find Galactic \"bones\" should allow us to exploit the Sun's position above the plane to gain a (very foreshortened) view \"from above\" of the Milky Way's structure.",

        "Abstract": "Gamma-ray searches for dark matter annihilation and decay in dwarf galaxies rely on an understanding of the dark matter density profiles of these systems. Conversely, uncertainties in these density profiles propagate into the derived particle physics limits as systematic errors. In this paper we quantify the expected dark matter signal from 20 Milky Way dwarfs using a uniform analysis of the most recent stellar-kinematic data available. Assuming that the observed stellar populations are equilibrium tracers of spherically-symmetric gravitational potentials that are dominated by dark matter, we find that current stellar-kinematic data can predict the amplitudes of annihilation signals to within a factor of a few for the ultra-faint dwarfs of greatest interest. On the other hand, the expected signal from several classical dwarfs (with high-quality observations of large numbers of member stars) can be localized to the ~20% level. These results are important for designing maximally sensitive searches in current and future experiments using space and ground-based instruments.",

        "Authors": "Rui Sun,Heng Xiao",
        "Abstract": "Coarse graining is an important ingredient in many multi-scale continuum-discrete solvers such as CFD--DEM (computational fluid dynamics--discrete element method) solvers for dense particle-laden flows. Although CFD--DEM solvers have become a mature technique that is widely used in multiphase flow research and industrial flow simulations, a flexible and easy-to-implement coarse graining algorithm that can work with CFD solvers of arbitrary meshes is still lacking. In this work, we proposed a new coarse graining algorithm for continuum--discrete solvers for dense particle-laden flows based on solving a transient diffusion equation. Via theoretical analysis we demonstrated that the proposed method is equivalent to the statistical kernel method with a Gaussian kernel, but the current method is much more straightforward to implement in CFD--DEM solvers. \\textit{A priori} numerical tests were performed to obtain the solid volume fraction fields based on given particle distributions, the results obtained by using the proposed algorithm were compared with those from other coarse graining methods in the literature (e.g., the particle centroid method, the divided particle volume method, and the two-grid formulation). The numerical tests demonstrated that the proposed coarse graining procedure based on solving diffusion equations is theoretically sound, easy to implement and parallelize in general CFD solvers, and has improved mesh-convergence characteristics compared with existing coarse graining methods. The diffusion-based coarse graining method has been implemented into a CFD--DEM solver, the results of which are presented in a separate work (R. Sun and H. Xiao, Diffusion-based coarse graining in hybrid continuum-discrete solvers: Application in CFD-DEM solvers for particle laden flows).",

        "Abstract": "A brisk building boom of hydropower mega-dams is underway from China to Brazil. Whether benefits of new dams will outweigh costs remains unresolved despite contentious debates. We investigate this question with the \"outside view\" or \"reference class forecasting\" based on literature on decision-making under uncertainty in psychology. We find overwhelming evidence that budgets are systematically biased below actual costs of large hydropower dams - excluding inflation, substantial debt servicing, environmental, and social costs. Using the largest and most reliable reference data of its kind and multilevel statistical techniques applied to large dams for the first time, we were successful in fitting parsimonious models to predict cost and schedule overruns. The outside view suggests that in most countries large hydropower dams will be too costly in absolute terms and take too long to build to deliver a positive risk-adjusted return unless suitable risk management measures outlined in this paper can be affordably provided. Policymakers, particularly in developing countries, are advised to prefer agile energy alternatives that can be built over shorter time horizons to energy megaprojects.",

        "Abstract": "Music autotagging, an established problem in Music Information Retrieval, aims to alleviate the human cost required to manually annotate collections of recorded music with textual labels by automating the process. Many autotagging systems have been proposed and evaluated by procedures and datasets that are now standard (used in MIREX, for instance). Very little work, however, has been dedicated to determine what these evaluations really mean about an autotagging system, or the comparison of two systems, for the problem of annotating music in the real world. In this article, we are concerned with explaining the figure of merit of an autotagging system evaluated with a standard approach. Specifically, does the figure of merit, or a comparison of figures of merit, warrant a conclusion about how well autotagging systems have learned to describe music with a specific vocabulary? The main contributions of this paper are a formalization of the notion of validity in autotagging evaluation, and a method to test it in general. We demonstrate the practical use of our method in experiments with three specific state-of-the-art autotagging systems --all of which are reproducible using the linked code and data. Our experiments show for these specific systems in a simple and objective two-class task that the standard evaluation approach does not provide valid indicators of their performance.",

        "Authors": "Kevin B. Stevenson,Jacob L. Bean,Daniel Fabrycky,Laura Kreidberg",
        "Abstract": "The detection of small planets orbiting nearby stars is an important step towards the identification of Earth twins. In previous work using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we found evidence to support at least one sub-Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting the nearby mid-M dwarf star GJ 436. As a follow up, here we used the Hubble Space Telescope to investigate the existence of one of these candidate planets, UCF-1.01, by searching for two transit signals as it passed in front of its host star. Interpretation of the data hinges critically on correctly modeling and removing the WFC3 instrument systematics from the light curves. Building on previous HST work, we demonstrate that WFC3 analyses need to explore the use of a quadratic function to fit a visit-long time-dependent systematic. This is important for establishing absolute transit and eclipse depths in the white light curves of all transiting systems. The work presented here exemplifies this point by putatively detecting the primary transit of UCF-1.01 with the use of a linear trend. However, using a quadratic trend, we achieve a better fit to the white light curves and a reduced transit depth that is inconsistent with previous Spitzer measurements. Furthermore, quadratic trends with or without a transit model component produce comparable fits to the available data. Using extant WFC3 transit light curves for GJ436b, we further validate the quadratic model component by achieving photon-limited model fit residuals and consistent transit depths over multiple epochs. We conclude that, when we fit for a quadratic trend, our new data contradict the prediction of a sub-Earth-sized planet orbiting GJ 436 with the size, period, and ephemeris posited from the Spitzer data by a margin of 3.1{\\sigma}.",

        "Authors": "Abhijit Chandra,Oliva Kar,Kuan-Chuen Wu,Michelle Hall,Jason Gillette",
        "Abstract": "Individuals who suffer anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury are at higher risk of developing knee osteoarthritis (OA) and almost 50% display symptoms 10 to 20 years post injury. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) often does not protect against knee OA development. Accordingly, a multiscale formulation for Data Driven Prognosis (DDP) of post ACLR is developed. Unlike traditional predictive strategies that require controlled off-line measurements or training for determination of constitutive parameters to derive the transitional statistics, the proposed DDP algorithm relies solely on in situ measurements. The proposed DDP scheme is capable of predicting onset of instabilities. Since the need for off line testing (or training) is obviated, it can be easily implemented for ACLR, where such controlled a priori testing is almost impossible to conduct. The DDP algorithm facilitates hierarchical handling of the large data set, and can assess the state of recovery in post ACLR conditions based on data collected from stair ascent and descent exercises of subjects. The DDP algorithm identifies inefficient knee varus motion and knee rotation as primary difficulties experienced by some of the post ACLR population. In such cases, levels of energy dissipation rate at the knee, and its fluctuation may be used as measures for assessing progress after ACL reconstruction.",

        "Abstract": "Once upon a time there was an esoteric and specialized notion, called \"size of the Durfee square\", of interest to at most 100 specialists in the whole world. Then it was kissed by a prince called Jorge Hirsch, and became the famous (and to quite a few people, infamous) h-index, of interest to every scientist, and scholar, since it tells you how productive a scientist (or scholar) you are! When Rodney Canfield, Sylvie Corteel, and Carla Savage wrote their beautiful 1998 article proving, rigorously, by a very deep and intricate analysis, the asymptotic normality of the random variable \"size of Durfee square\" defined on integer-partitions of n (as n goes to infinity), with precise asymptotics for the mean and variance, they did not dream that one day their result should be of interest to everyone who has ever published a paper.However Canfield et. al. had to work really hard to prove their deep result. Here we take an \"empirical\" shortcut, that proves the same thing much faster (modulo routine number- and symbol- crunching). More importantly, the empirical methodology should be useful in many other cases where rigorous proofs are either too hard, or not worth the trouble!",

        "Authors": "Ali Gorcin,Huseyin Arslan",
        "Abstract": "Distinction of OFDM signals from single carrier signals is highly important for adaptive receiver algorithms and signal identification applications. OFDM signals exhibit Gaussian characteristics in time domain and fourth order cumulants of Gaussian distributed signals vanish in contrary to the cumulants of other signals. Thus fourth order cumulants can be utilized for OFDM signal identification. In this paper, first, formulations of the estimates of the fourth order cumulants for OFDM signals are provided. Then it is shown these estimates are affected significantly from the wireless channel impairments, frequency offset, phase offset and sampling mismatch. To overcome these problems, a general chi-square constant false alarm rate Gaussianity test which employs estimates of cumulants and their covariances is adapted to the specific case of wireless OFDM signals. Estimation of the covariance matrix of the fourth order cumulants are greatly simplified peculiar to the OFDM signals. A measurement setup is developed to analyze the performance of the identification method and for comparison purposes. A parametric measurement analysis is provided depending on modulation order, signal to noise ratio, number of symbols, and degree of freedom of the underlying test. The proposed method outperforms statistical tests which are based on fixed thresholds or empirical values, while a priori information requirement and complexity of the proposed method are lower than the coherent identification techniques.",

We show that SN 1997bs remains much fainter than its progenitor, posing a challenge for the canonical picture of late-time obscuration by dust forming in a shell ejected during the transient. The possibility that the star survived cloaked behind a dusty, steady wind is also disfavored. The simplest explanation is that SN 1997bs was a subluminous Type IIn SN, although it is currently impossible to rule out the possibility that the star survived either behind an obscuring dusty shell $\\gtrsim 1 M_{\\odot}$ or with a significantly decreased intrinsic luminosity. Continued monitoring of the system is the most promising means of ultimately resolving the question.",

        "Abstract": "Spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry---known as `density wave' order---is common in nature. However such states are strongly sensitive to impurities or other forms of frozen disorder leading to fascinating glassy phenomena. We analyze impurity effects on a particularly ubiquitous form of broken translation symmetry in solids: a Spin Density Wave (SDW) with spatially modulated magnetic order. Related phenomena occur in Pair Density Wave (PDW) superconductors where the superconducting order is spatially modulated. For weak disorder, we find that the SDW / PDW order can generically give way to a SDW / PDW glass---new phases of matter with a number of striking properties, which we introduce and characterize here. In particular, they exhibit an interesting combination of conventional (symmetry-breaking) and spin glass (Edwards-Anderson) order. This is reflected in the dynamic response of such a system, which---as expected for a glass---is extremely slow in certain variables, but---surprisingly---is fast in others. Our results apply to all uniaxial metallic SDW systems where the ordering vector is incommensurate with the crystalline lattice. In addition, the possibility of a PDW glass has important consequences for some recent theoretical and experimental work on $La_{2-x}Ba_xCu_2O_4$.",

        "Abstract": "The physical mechanisms of the quasar ultraviolet (UV)-optical variability are not well understood despite the long history of observations. Recently, Dexter & Agol presented a model of quasar UV-optical variability, which assumes large local temperature fluctuations in the quasar accretion discs. This inhomogeneous accretion disc model is claimed to describe not only the single-band variability amplitude, but also microlensing size constraints and the quasar composite spectral shape. In this work, we examine the validity of the inhomogeneous accretion disc model in the light of quasar UV-optical spectral variability by using five-band multi-epoch light curves for nearly 9 000 quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 region. By comparing the values of the intrinsic scatter $\\sigma_{\\text{int}}$ of the two-band magnitude-magnitude plots for the SDSS quasar light curves and for the simulated light curves, we show that Dexter & Agol's inhomogeneous accretion disc model cannot explain the tight inter-band correlation often observed in the SDSS quasar light curves. This result leads us to conclude that the local temperature fluctuations in the accretion discs are not the main driver of the several years' UV-optical variability of quasars, and consequently, that the assumption that the quasar accretion discs have large localized temperature fluctuations is not preferred from the viewpoint of the UV-optical spectral variability.",

        "Abstract": "Candidates for the modest galaxies that formed most of the stars in the early universe, at redshifts $z > 7$, have been found in large numbers with extremely deep restframe-UV imaging. But it has proved difficult for existing spectrographs to characterise them in the UV. The detailed properties of these galaxies could be measured from dust and cool gas emission at far-infrared wavelengths if the galaxies have become sufficiently enriched in dust and metals. So far, however, the most distant UV-selected galaxy detected in dust emission is only at $z = 3.25$, and recent results have cast doubt on whether dust and molecules can be found in typical galaxies at this early epoch. Here we report thermal dust emission from an archetypal early universe star-forming galaxy, A1689-zD1. We detect its stellar continuum in spectroscopy and determine its redshift to be $z = 7.5\\pm0.2$ from a spectroscopic detection of the Ly{\\alpha} break. A1689-zD1 is representative of the star-forming population during reionisation, with a total star-formation rate of about 12M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The galaxy is highly evolved: it has a large stellar mass, and is heavily enriched in dust, with a dust-to-gas ratio close to that of the Milky Way. Dusty, evolved galaxies are thus present among the fainter star-forming population at $z > 7$, in spite of the very short time since they first appeared.",

        "Authors": "Trisha Maitra,Sourabh Bhattacharya",
        "Abstract": "The problem of model selection in the context of a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) has not been touched upon in the literature. Indeed, properties of Bayes factors have not been studied even in single SDE based model comparison problems. In this article, we first develop an asymptotic theory of Bayes factors when two SDEs are compared, assuming the time domain expands. Using this we then develop an asymptotic theory of Bayes factors when systems of SDEs are compared, assuming that the number of equations in each system, as well as the time domain, increase indefinitely. Our asymptotic theory covers situations when the observed processes associated with the SDEs are independently and identically distributed (iid), as well as when they are independently but not identically distributed (non-iid). Quite importantly, we allow inclusion of available time-dependent covariate information into each SDE through a multiplicative factor of the drift function in a random effects set-up; different initial values for the SDEs are also permitted. Thus, our general model-selection framework includes simultaneously the variable selection problem associated with time-varying covariates, as well as choice of the part of the drift function free of covariates. As we show, the Bayes factor is inconsistent for comparing individual SDEs, in the sense that the log-Bayes factor converges only in expectation, while the relevant variance does not converge to zero. Nevertheless, it has been possible to exploit this result to establish almost sure exponential convergence of the Bayes factor when, in addition, the number of individuals are also allowed to increase indefinitely. We carry out simulated and real data analyses to demonstrate that Bayes factor is a suitable candidate for covariate selection in our SDE models even in non-asymptotic situations.",

This approach yields contributions to the theory and practice of both connectionist computation and programming languages. Connectionist computations are carried out in a way that lets them communicate with, and be understood and interrogated directly in terms of the high-level semantics of a general-purpose programming language. Meanwhile, difficult (unbounded-dimension, NP-hard) search problems in programming that have previously been left to the programmer to solve in a heuristic, domain-specific way are solved uniformly a priori in a way that approximately achieves information-theoretic limits on performance.",

        "Abstract": "The neighbourhood-based Collaborative Filtering is a widely used method in recommender systems. However, the risks of revealing customers' privacy during the process of filtering have attracted noticeable public concern recently. Specifically, $k$NN attack discloses the target user's sensitive information by creating $k$ fake nearest neighbours by non-sensitive information. Among the current solutions against $k$NN attack, the probabilistic methods showed a powerful privacy preserving effect. However, the existing probabilistic methods neither guarantee enough prediction accuracy due to the global randomness, nor provide assured security enforcement against $k$NN attack. To overcome the problems of current probabilistic methods, we propose a novel approach, Partitioned Probabilistic Neighbour Selection, to ensure a required security guarantee while achieving the optimal prediction accuracy against $k$NN attack. In this paper, we define the sum of $k$ neighbours' similarity as the accuracy metric $\\alpha$, the number of user partitions, across which we select the $k$ neighbours, as the security metric $\\beta$. Differing from the present methods that globally selected neighbours, our method selects neighbours from each group with exponential differential privacy to decrease the magnitude of noise. Theoretical and experimental analysis show that to achieve the same security guarantee against $k$NN attack, our approach ensures the optimal prediction accuracy.",

Our model mainly considers two charge-separation pathways more than that in the published literature. The two pathways can interfere via cross-couplings and work together to enhance the charge-separation yields. We explore how these cross-couplings increase the current and voltage of the charge separation and discuss the advantages of multiple pathways in terms of current and power. The robustness of the BQHE against the charge recombination in natural PS{\\rm II} RC and dephasing induced by environments is also explored, and extension from two pathways to multiple pathways is made. These results suggest that nature-mimicking architectures with engineered multiple pathways for charge separations might be better for artificial solar energy devices.",

There is also evidence of sub-clustering seen in the spatial distributions of young stars and of gas and dust.Near- and mid-infrared photometry indicates that the stars exhibit colours compatible with reddening by interstellar and circumstellar dust and are likely to be low- and intermediate-mass YSOs with a large proportion of Class I YSOs.Ammonia and CO lines were detected, with the CO emission well centred near the position of the richest part of the cluster. The velocity of the CO and NH$_3$ lines indicates that the gas is Galactic and located at a distance of about 5.5 kpc, in the outer Galaxy.Herschel data of this region characterise the dust environment of this molecular cloud core where the young cluster is embedded.

I observe that if M is too large, it is uninteresting, because the value is in the selection, not in the totality; if it is smaller and interesting, it is not independent from us. Both alternatives challenge mathematical platonism. I suggest that the universality of our mathematics may be a prejudice hiding its contingency, and illustrate contingent aspects of classical geometry, arithmetic and linear algebra.",

        "Authors": "A. Karpova,D. Zyuzin,A. Danilenko,Yu. Shibanov",
        "Abstract": "We present spectral and timing analyses of the X-ray emission from the pulsar wind nebula DA 495 and its central object, J1952.2+2925, suggested to be the pulsar, using archival Chandra and XMM-Newton data. J1952.2+2925 has a pure thermal spectrum which is equally well fitted either by the blackbody model with a temperature of $\\approx 215$ eV and an emitting area radius of $\\approx 0.6$ km or by magnetized neutron star atmosphere models with temperatures of 80-90 eV. In the latter case the thermal emission can come from the entire neutron star surface which temperature is consistent with standard neutron star cooling scenarios. We place also an upper limit on the J1952.2+2925 nonthermal flux. The derived spectral parameters are generally compatible with published ones based only on the Chandra data, but they are much more accurate due to the inclusion of XMM-Newton data. No pulsations were found and we placed an upper limit for the J1952.2+2925 pulsed emission fraction of 40 per cent. Utilizing the interstellar absorption-distance relation, we estimated the distance to DA 495, which can be as large as 5 kpc if J1952.2+2925 emission is described by the atmosphere models. We compiled possible multi-wavelength spectra of the nebula including radio data; they depend on the spectral model of the central object. Comparing the results with other pulsar plus wind nebula systems we set reasonable constraints on the J1952.2+2925 spin-down luminosity and age. We suggest that the Fermi source 3FGL J1951.6+2926 is the likely $\\gamma$-ray counterpart of J1952.2+2925.",

        "Abstract": "This work presents a Boundary Element Method (BEM) formulation for contactless electromagnetic field assessments. The new scheme is based on a regularized BEM approach that requires the use of electric measurements only. The regularization is obtained by leveraging on an extension of Calderon techniques to rectangular systems leading to well-conditioned problems independent of the discretization density. This enables the use of highly discretized Huygens surfaces that can be consequently placed very near to the radiating source. In addition, the new regularized scheme is hybridized with both surfacic homogeneous and volumetric inhomogeneous forward BEM solvers accelerated with fast matrix-vector multiplication schemes. This allows for rapid and effective dosimetric assessments and permits the use of inhomogeneous and realistic head phantoms. Numerical results corroborate the theory and confirms the practical effectiveness of all newly proposed formulations.",

        "Abstract": "We investigate decoherence of quantum superpositions induced by gravitational time dilation and spontaneous emission between two atomic levels. It has been shown that gravitational time dilation can be an universal decoherence source. Here, we consider decoherence induced by gravitational time dilation only in the situation of spontaneous emission. Then, we obtain that the coherence of particle's position state depends on reference frame due to the time dilation changing the distinguishability of emission photon from two positions of particle. Changing the direction of light field can also result in the difference about the coherence of quantum superpositions. For observing the decoherence effect mainly due to gravitational time dilation, time-delayed feedback can be utilized to increase the decoherence of particle's superpositions.",

        "Abstract": "This study will explicitly demonstrate by example that an unrestricted infinite and forward recursive hierarchy of differential equations must be identified as an unclosed system of equations, despite the fact that to each unknown function in the hierarchy there exists a corresponding determined equation to which it can be bijectively mapped to. As a direct consequence, its admitted set of symmetry transformations must be identified as a weaker set of indeterminate equivalence transformations. The reason is that no unique general solution can be constructed, not even in principle. Instead, infinitely many disjoint and thus independent general solution manifolds exist. This is in clear contrast to a closed system of differential equations that only allows for a single and thus unique general solution manifold, which, by definition, covers all possible particular solutions this system can admit. Herein, different first order Riccati-ODEs serve as an example, but this analysis is not restricted to them. All conclusions drawn in this study will translate to any first order or higher order ODEs as well as to any PDEs.",

        "Abstract": "The $k$-nearest neighbour ($k$-NN) classifier is one of the oldest and most important supervised learning algorithms for classifying datasets. Traditionally the Euclidean norm is used as the distance for the $k$-NN classifier. In this thesis we investigate the use of alternative distances for the $k$-NN classifier.We start by introducing some background notions in statistical machine learning. We define the $k$-NN classifier and discuss Stone's theorem and the proof that $k$-NN is universally consistent on the normed space $R^d$. We then prove that $k$-NN is universally consistent if we take a sequence of random norms (that are independent of the sample and the query) from a family of norms that satisfies a particular boundedness condition. We extend this result by replacing norms with distances based on uniformly locally Lipschitz functions that satisfy certain conditions. We discuss the limitations of Stone's lemma and Stone's theorem, particularly with respect to quasinorms and adaptively choosing a distance for $k$-NN based on the labelled sample. We show the universal consistency of a two stage $k$-NN type classifier where we select the distance adaptively based on a split labelled sample and the query. We conclude by giving some examples of improvements of the accuracy of classifying various datasets using the above techniques.",

        "Authors": "Alberto Carrasco-Casado,Jose Manuel Sanchez-Pena,Ricardo Vergaz",
        "Abstract": "The amount of scientific data to be transmitted from deep-space probes is very limited due to RF-communications constraints. Free-space optical communication can alleviate this bottleneck, increasing data rate while reducing weight, mass and power of communication onboard equipment. Nevertheless, optimizing the power delivery from spacecraft to Earth is needed. In RF communications, the strategy has been to increase the aperture of ground terminals. Free-space optical communications can also follow it, as they share the limitation of low power received on Earth. As the cost of big telescopes increases exponentially with aperture, new ideas are required to maximize the aperture-to-cost ratio. This work explores the feasibility of using telescopes of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array as optical-communication ground stations. Ground-based gamma-ray astronomy has the same power limitation, hence Cherenkov telescopes are designed to maximize receiver's aperture with minimum cost and some relaxed requirements. Both critical issues of the reutilization and possible adaptations of the telescopes to optimize them for communications, and telescopes simulations and numerical computations of several link budgets applied to worst-case scenarios are discussed, concluding that the proposal is technically feasible and would bring important cost reductions and performance improvements compared to current designs for deepspace optical ground stations.",

        "Abstract": "We extend the Landauer-B\u00fcttiker probe formalism for conductances to the high bias regime, and study the effects of environmentally-induced elastic and inelastic scattering on charge current in single molecule junctions, focusing on high-bias effects. The probe technique phenomenologically incorporates incoherent elastic and inelastic effects to the fully coherent case, mimicking a rich physical environment at trivial cost. We further identify environmentally-induced mechanisms which generate an asymmetry in the current, manifested as a weak diode behavior. This rectifying behavior, found in two types of molecular junction models, is absent in the coherent-elastic limit, and is only active in the case with incoherent-inelastic scattering. Our work illustrates that in the low bias - linear response regime, the commonly used \"dephasing probe\" (mimicking only elastic decoherence effects) operates nearly indistinguishably from a \"voltage probe\" (admitting inelastic-dissipative effects). However, these probes realize fundamentally distinct $I$-$V$ characteristics at high biases, reflecting the central roles of dissipation and inelastic scattering processes on molecular electronic transport far-from-equilibrium.",

        "Abstract": "Core-collapse supernovae (SNe), marking the deaths of massive stars, are among the most powerful explosions in the Universe, responsible, e.g., for a predominant synthesis of chemical elements in their host galaxies. The majority of massive stars are thought to be born in close binary systems. To date, putative binary companions to the progenitors of SNe may have been detected in only two cases, SNe 1993J and 2011dh. We report on the search for a companion of the progenitor of the Type Ic SN 1994I, long considered to have been the result of binary interaction. Twenty years after explosion, we used the Hubble Space Telescope to observe the SN site in the ultraviolet (F275W and F336W bands), resulting in deep upper limits on the expected companion: F275W > 26.1 mag and F336W > 24.7 mag. These allows us to exclude the presence of a main sequence companion with a mass >~ 10 Msun. Through comparison with theoretical simulations of possible progenitor populations, we show that the upper limits to a companion detection exclude interacting binaries with semi-conservative (late Case A or early Case B) mass transfer. The limits tend to favor systems with non-conservative, late Case B mass transfer with intermediate initial orbital periods and mass ratios. The most likely mass range for a putative main sequence companion would be ~5--12 Msun, the upper end of which corresponds to the inferred upper detection limit.",

        "Authors": "Remco F.J. van der Burg,Adam Muzzin,Henk Hoekstra",
        "Abstract": "Recent observations have highlighted a significant population of faint but large (r_eff>1.5 kpc) galaxies in the Coma cluster. The origin of these Ultra Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs) remains puzzling, as the interpretation of the observational results has been hindered by the subjective selection of UDGs, and the limited study of only the Coma (and some examples in the Virgo-) cluster. We extend the study of UDGs using 8 clusters in the redshift range 0.044<z<0.063 with deep g- and r-band imaging data taken with MegaCam at the CFHT. We describe an automatic selection pipeline for quantitative identification, tested for completeness using image simulations of these galaxies. We find that the abundance of the UDGs we can detect increases with cluster mass, reaching ~200 in typical haloes of M200~10^15 Msun. The cluster UDGs have colours consistent with the cluster red sequence, and have a steep size distribution that declines as n~r_eff^-3.4. Their radial distribution is significantly steeper than NFW in the outskirts, and is significantly shallower in the inner parts. They follow the same radial distribution as the more massive quiescent galaxies in the clusters, except within the core region of r<0.15XR200 (or <300 kpc). Within this region the number density of UDGs drops and is consistent with zero. These diffuse galaxies can only resist tidal forces down to this cluster-centric distance if they are highly centrally dark-matter dominated. The observation that the radial distribution of more compact dwarf galaxies (r_eff<1.0 kpc) with similar luminosities follows the same distribution as the UDGs, but exist down to a smaller distance of 100kpc from the cluster centres, indicates that they may have similarly massive sub-haloes as the UDGs. Although several scenarios can give rise to the UDG population, our results point to differences in the formation history as the most plausible explanation.",

        "Authors": "Eduardo C. Padovani",
        "Abstract": "Several experiments provide evidence that specialized brain regions functionally interact and reveal that the brain processes and integrates information in a specific and structured manner. Networks can be applied to model brain functional activities, providing means to characterize and quantify this structured form of organization. Reports substantiate that different physiological states or diseases that affect the central nervous system may be associated with alterations in these networks, which might be reflected in graphs of different architectures. However, the relationship between their structure and the organism's distinct physiological conditions is poorly comprehended. Therefore, experiments that estimate the functional neural networks of subjects exposed to different controlled conditions are highly relevant. Within this context, this research has sought to model large-scale functional brain networks during an anesthetic induction process. The experiment was based on intra-cranial recordings of the neural activities of an old-world macaque of the species Macaca fuscata. Neural activity was recorded during a Ketamine-Medetomidine anesthetic induction process, and networks were estimated sequentially in five-second intervals. One and a half minutes after administering the anesthetics, changes occurred in various network properties, revealing a transition in the network architecture. During general anesthesia, functional connectivity and network integration capabilities were reduced at both local and global levels. Additionally, it has been verified that the brain shifted to a highly specific and dynamic state. The results provide empirical evidence and report the relationship between the induced state of anesthesia and functional network properties, contributing to the elucidation of novel aspects of the neural correlates of consciousness.",

        "Authors": "Geoff Boeing",
        "Abstract": "The city of Honolulu, Hawaii is currently planning and developing a new rail transit system. While Honolulu has supportive density and topography for rail transit, questions remain about its ability to effectively integrate urban design and accessibility across the system. Every transit trip begins and ends with a walking trip from origins and to destinations: transportation planning must account for pedestrian safety, comfort, and access. Ildefons Cerda's 19th century utopian plan for Barcelona's Eixample district produced a renowned, livable urban form. The Eixample, with its well-integrated rail transit, serves as a model of urban design, land use, transportation planning, and pedestrian-scaled streets working in synergy to produce accessibility. This study discusses the urban form of Honolulu and the history and planning of its new rail transit system. Then it reviews the history of Cerda's plan for the Eixample and discusses its urban form and performance today. Finally it draws several lessons from Barcelona's urban design, accessibility, and rail transit planning and critically discusses their applicability to policy and design in Honolulu. This discussion is situated within wider debates around livable cities and social justice as it contributes several form and design lessons to the livability and accessibility literature while identifying potential concerns with privatization and displacement.",

By applying convex combination method and minimizing distance function method, the deterministic MMSTP is reduced into single objective programming problems. Thus, both single objective programming problems are solved using Maple 18.02 optimization toolbox. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the performance of the models.",

        "Authors": "M. Chen,V.W. Scarola",
        "Abstract": "Artificial spin-orbit coupling in optical lattices can be engineered to tune band structure into extreme regimes where the single-particle band flattens leaving only inter-particle interactions to define many-body states of matter. Lin et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett 112, 110404 (2014)] showed that under such conditions interactions lead to a Wigner crystal of fermionic atoms under approximate conditions: no bandwidth or band mixing. The excitations were shown to possess emergent kinetics with fractionalized charge derived entirely from interactions. In this work we use numerical exact diagonalization to study a more realistic model with non-zero bandwidth and band mixing. We map out the stability phase diagram of the Wigner crystal. We find that emergent properties of the Wigner crystal excitations remain stable for realistic experimental parameters. Our results validate the approximations made by Lin et al. and define parameter regimes where strong interaction effects generate emergent kinetics in optical lattices.",

        "Abstract": "We present the interesting coincidence of cosmology and astrophysics that points toward a dimensionless age of the universe H_0*t_0 that is close to one. Despite cosmic deceleration for 9 Gyr and acceleration since then, we find H_0t*_0 = 0.96 +/- 0.01 for the LCDM model that fits SN Ia data from Pan-STARRS, CMB power spectra, and baryon acoustic oscillations. Similarly, astrophysical measures of stellar ages and the Hubble constant derived from redshifts and distances point to H_0*t ~ 1.0 +/- 0.1$. The wide range of possible values for H_0*t_0 realized during comic evolution means that we live at what appears to be a special time. This \"synchronicity problem\" is not precisely the same as the usual Coincidence problem because there are combinations of Omega_Matter and Omega_Lambda for which the usual coincidence problem holds but for which H_0*t_0 is not close to 1.",

        "Authors": "Andrea Passamonti,Taner Akg\u00fcn,Jos\u00e9 A. Pons,Juan A. Miralles",
        "Abstract": "We study ambipolar diffusion in strongly magnetised neutron stars, with special focus on the effects of neutrino reaction rates and the impact of a superfluid/superconducting transition in the neutron star core. For axisymmetric magnetic field configurations, we determine the deviation from $\\beta-$equilibrium induced by the magnetic force and calculate the velocity of the slow, quasi-stationary, ambipolar drift. We study the temperature dependence of the velocity pattern and clearly identify the transition to a predominantly solenoidal flow. For stars without superconducting/superfluid constituents and with a mixed poloidal-toroidal magnetic field of typical magnetar strength, we find that ambipolar diffusion proceeds fast enough to have a significant impact on the magnetic field evolution only at low core temperatures, $T \\lesssim 1-2\\times10^8$ K. The ambipolar diffusion timescale becomes appreciably shorter when fast neutrino reactions are present, because the possibility to balance part of the magnetic force with pressure gradients is reduced. We also find short ambipolar diffusion timescales in the case of superconducting cores for $T \\lesssim 10^9$ K, due to the reduced interaction between protons and neutrons. In the most favourable scenario, with fast neutrino reactions and superconducting cores, ambipolar diffusion results in advection velocities of several km/kyr. This velocity can substantially reorganize magnetic fields in magnetar cores, in a way that can only be confirmed by dynamical simulations.",

In particular, the linear term is reduced to the Einstein-Hilbert action with cosmological constant in eight dimensions. We prove that such a reduced action is equivalent to the Lovelock action in eight dimensions.",

        "Authors": "Igor V. Ovchinnikov,Wenyuan Li,Yuquan Sun,Robert N. Schwartz,Andrew E. Hudson,Karlheinz Meier,Kang L. Wang",
        "Abstract": "In many stochastic dynamical systems, ordinary chaotic behavior is preceded by a full-dimensional phase that exhibits 1/f-type power-spectra and/or scale-free statistics of (anti)instantons such as neuroavalanches, earthquakes, etc. In contrast with the phenomenological concept of self-organized criticality, the recently developed approximation-free supersymmetric theory of stochastic differential equations, or stochastics, (STS) identifies this phase as the noise-induced chaos (N-phase), i.e., the phase where the topological supersymmetry pertaining to all stochastic dynamical systems is broken spontaneously by the condensation of the noise-induced (anti-)instantons. Here, we support this picture in the context of neurodynamics. We study a 1D chain of neuron-like elements and find that the dynamics in the N-phase is indeed featured by positive stochastic Lyapunov exponents and dominated by (anti)instantonic processes of (creation)annihilation of kinks and antikinks, which can be viewed as predecessors of boundaries of neuroavalanches. We also construct the phase diagram of emulated stochastic neurodynamics on Spikey neuromorphic hardware and demonstrate that the width of the N-phase vanishes in the deterministic limit in accordance with STS. As a first result of the application of STS to neurodynamics comes the conclusion that a conscious brain can reside only in the N-phase.",

        "Title": "A torsion pendulum ground test of the LISA Pathfinder Free-fall mode",
        "Authors": "Giuliana Russano",
        "Abstract": "LISA Pathfinder is the technological demonstrator space mission for the future gravitational waves observatory in space eLISA, with the aim of measure the differential acceleration between free-falling test masses orbiting in the same apparatus at a level of 30 fm/s-2Hz-1/2 at 1 mHz. Because the satellite can't follow the two masses at the same time, the second mass must be forced to follow either the other one or the spacecraft. The actuation force applied to compensate this effect introduces a dominant source of force noise in the mission noise budget at frequency near and below the mHz. The free-fall mode actuation control scheme has been designed to suppress this noise source and avoid actuation instabilities: actuation is limited to brief periodic impulses, with test masses in free fall in between two kicks. This actuation-free motion is then analyzed for the remaining sources of acceleration ultra noise. A free-fall mode parallel testing has been successfully implemented on torsion pendulum facility at the University of Trento and the results of the measurement campaign are ready to be shown and discussed. The implementation of the data analysis algorithms to estimate the spectrum of the acceleration of the controlled test mass, and the estimation of system parameters such as the force gradients, stiffness terms, are also part of this work. The free-fall mode has been tested at the level of 2 fNm/Hz-1/2, at the frequencies of 1 mHz, corresponding to an acceleration of about 100 fm /s-2 Hz-1/2. The ground tests have nevertheless allowed to develop and test quantitatively this innovative method of noise reduction due to actuation noise, contributing to its development for the LISA Pathfinder mission.",

        "Authors": "Shima Alizadeh,Ali Mani",
        "Abstract": "We present an efficient and robust numerical model for simulation of electrokinetic phenomena in porous networks over a wide range of applications including energy conversion, desalination, and lab-on-a-chip systems. Coupling between fluid flow and ion transport in these networks is governed by the Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Stokes equations. These equations describe a wide range of transport phenomena that can interact in complex and highly nonlinear ways in networks involving multiple pores with variable properties. Capturing these phenomena by direct simulation of the governing equations in multiple dimensions is prohibitively expensive. We present here a reduced order computational model that treats a network of many pores via solutions to 1D equations. Assuming that each pore in the network is long and thin, we derive a 1D model describing the transport in pore's longitudinal direction. We take into account the non-uniformity of potential and ion concentration profiles across the pore cross-section in the form of area-averaged coefficients in different flux terms representing fluid flow, electric current, and ion fluxes. Distinct advantages of the present framework include: a fully conservative discretization, fully bounded tabulated area-averaged coefficients without any singularity in the limit of infinitely thick electric double layers (EDLs), a flux discretization that exactly preserves equilibrium conditions, and extension to general network of pores with multiple intersections. By considering a hierarchy of canonical problems with increasing complexity, we demonstrate that the developed framework can capture a wide range of phenomena. Example demonstrations include, prediction of osmotic pressure built up in thin pores subject to concentration gradient, propagation of deionization shocks and induced recirculations for intersecting pores with varying properties.",

We also analyse a specific limit of this generalized deformation for one dimensional system, and in that limit, a nonlocal deformation of the momentum operator generates a local deformation of all one dimensional quantum mechanical systems. We analyse the low energy effects of this deformation on a harmonic oscillator, Landau levels, Lamb shift, and potential barrier. We also demonstrate that this deformation leads to a discretization of space.",

Three molecules (CN, CH3OH, and HNCO) were detected for the first time in the nuclear region of NGC 4038. High-resolution mapping reveals a systematic difference in distributions of different molecular species and continuum emission. Active star forming regions identified by the 3 mm and 850 um continuum emission are offset from the gas-rich region associated with the HCN (1-0) and CO (3-2) peaks. The CN (1-0)/HCN (1-0) line ratios are enhanced (CN/HCN = 0.8-1.2) in the star forming regions, suggesting that the regions are photon dominated. The large molecular gas mass (10^8 Msun) within a 0.6\" (~60 pc) radius of the CO (3-2) peak and a high dense gas fraction (>20 %) suggested by the HCN (1-0)/CO (3-2) line ratio may signify a future burst of intense star formation there. The shocked gas traced in the CH3OH and HNCO emission indicates sub-kpc scale molecular shocks. We suggest that the molecular shocks may be driven by collisions between inflowing gas and the central massive molecular complex.",

In a scenario in which the data does not fit in memory, it is worth to consider exchanging less memory usage for more processing time in order to enable the computation of the inverse which otherwise would be prohibitive. We propose a new algorithm to compute the inverse of block partitioned matrices with a reduced memory footprint. The algorithm works recursively to invert one block of a $k \\times k$ block matrix $M$, with $k \\geq 2$, based on the successive splitting of $M$. It computes one block of the inverse at a time, in order to limit memory usage during the entire processing. Experimental results show that, despite increasing computational complexity, matrices that otherwise would exceed the memory-usage limit can be inverted using this technique.",

The pulsar is detected in both bands with fluxes F(1250-2000 A)= (2.5+/-0.3)x10^-16 erg/s/cm^2 and F(3800-6000 A)=(6.4+/-0.4)x10^-17 erg/s/cm^2, which correspond to luminosities of ~5.8x10^27 and 1.4x10^27 erg/s, for d=410 pc and E(B-V)=0.03. The optical-FUV spectrum can be described by a power-law model, f_nu~nu^alpha, with slope alpha=0.18-0.48 for a conservative range of color excess, E(B-V)=0.01-0.08. Since a spectral flux rising with frequency is unusual for pulsar magnetospheric emission in this frequency range, it is possible that the spectrum is predominantly magnetospheric (power law with alpha<0) in the optical while it is dominated by thermal emission from the neutron star surface in the FUV. For a neutron star radius of 12 km, the surface temperature would be between 0.5x10^5 and 2.1x10^5 K, for alpha ranging from -1 to 0, E(B-V)=0.01-0.08, and d=340-500 pc. In addition to the pulsar, the FUV images reveal extended emission spatially coincident with the known Halpha bow shock, making PSR J2124-3358 the second pulsar (after PSR J0437-4715) with a bow shock detected in FUV.",

For this application the frequency stability of the etalon is critical, as its transmission spectrum is susceptible to frequency fluctuations due to changes in cavity temperature, optical power and input polarization. In this paper we present a laser frequency comb measurement technique to characterize the frequency stability of a custom-designed fiber Fabry-Perot interferometer (FFP). Simultaneously probing the stability of two etalon resonance modes, we assess both the absolute stability of the etalon and the long-term stability of the cavity dispersion. We measure mode positions with MHz precision, which corresponds to splitting the FFP resonances by a part in 500 and to RV precision of ~1 m/s. We address limiting systematic effects, including the presence of parasitic etalons, that need to be overcome to push the metrology of this system to the equivalent RV precision of 10 cm/s. Our results demonstrate a means to characterize environmentally-driven perturbations of etalon resonance modes across broad spectral bandwidths, as well as motivate the benefits and challenges of FFPs as spectrograph calibrators.",

The electron ionization and the enhancement of HHG yield in ground and first excited states, as the initial states, is studied and a strong orientation effect for ionization of electron in $2p\\sigma$ state is discovered, that it can be used to reach a longer lifetime for the electron in the first excited state, which is responsible for the enhancement in HHG yield, during the high harmonic emission. In order to investigate effect of plasmonic field on the cutoff position of HHG spectra, first the enhancement of laser field in a nano-antennae is calculated and then the interaction of the enhanced field with HeH$^{2+}$ molecule is studied by solving the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation. According to the results, when HeH$^{2+}$ molecule, in the initial state of $2p\\sigma$, is irradiated by plasmonic polarized laser field, with the polarization normal to the molecular axis, the HHG yield and cutoff position enhance while the excited state has a long lifetime during the HHG process.",

(1977) had found it to be fading between the late 1940s and mid-1970s, or that it had rebrightened and then resumed fading sometime between the mid-1970s and mid-1990s, in L band (1.4 GHz). Here, we present 15 additional years of observations of Cas A and Cyg A with the 40-foot in L band, and three and a half additional years of observations of Cas A, Cyg A, Tau A, and Vir A with GBO's recently refurbished 20-meter telescope in L and X (9 GHz) bands. We also present a more sophisticated analysis of the 40-foot data, and a reanalysis of the Baars et al. (1977) data, which reveals small, but non-negligible differences. We find that overall, between the late 1950s and late 2010s, Cas A faded at an average rate of $0.670 \\pm 0.019$ %/yr in L band, consistent with Reichart & Stephens (2000). However, we also find, at the 6.3$\\sigma$ credible level, that it did not fade at a constant rate. Rather, Cas A faded at a faster rate through at least the late 1960s, rebrightened (or at least faded at a much slower rate), and then resumed fading at a similarly fast rate by, at most, the late 1990s. Given these differences from the original Baars et al. (1977) analysis, and given the importance of their fitted spectral and temporal models for flux-density calibration in radio astronomy, we update and improve on these models for all four of these radio sources. In doing so, we additionally find that Tau A is fading at a rate of $0.102^{+0.042}_{-0.043}$ %/yr in L band.",

Our focus is on soft-wall models that naturally realize a light radion/dilaton and suppressed dynamical contribution to the cosmological constant. We discuss phenomenology of the phase transition after developing a theoretical and numerical analysis of these models both at zero and finite temperature. We demonstrate a model with a TeV-Planck hierarchy and with a successful cosmological phase transition where the UV value of the curvature corresponds, via AdS/CFT, to an $N$ of $20$, where 5D gravity is expected to be firmly in the perturbative regime.",

        "Abstract": "Video analytics requires operating with large amounts of data. Compressive sensing allows to reduce the number of measurements required to represent the video using the prior knowledge of sparsity of the original signal, but it imposes certain conditions on the design matrix. The Bayesian compressive sensing approach relaxes the limitations of the conventional approach using the probabilistic reasoning and allows to include different prior knowledge about the signal structure. This paper presents two Bayesian compressive sensing methods for autonomous object detection in a video sequence from a static camera. Their performance is compared on the real datasets with the non-Bayesian greedy algorithm. It is shown that the Bayesian methods can provide the same accuracy as the greedy algorithm but much faster; or if the computational time is not critical they can provide more accurate results.",

        "Authors": "Joseph Bramante,Tim Linden,Yu-Dai Tsai",
        "Abstract": "We identify new astrophysical signatures of dark matter that implodes neutron stars (NSs), which could decisively test whether NS-imploding dark matter is responsible for missing pulsars in the Milky Way galactic center, the source of some $r$-process elements, and the origin of fast-radio bursts. First, NS-imploding dark matter forms $\\sim 10^{-10}$ solar mass or smaller black holes inside neutron stars, which proceed to convert neutron stars into $\\sim$1.5 solar mass BHs. This decreases the number of neutron star mergers seen by LIGO/Virgo (LV) and associated merger kilonovae seen by telescopes like DES, BlackGEM, and ZTF, and instead, producing a population of \"black mergers\" containing $\\sim$1.5 solar mass black holes. Second, dark matter-induced neutron star implosions may create a new kind of kilonovae that lacks a detectable, accompanying gravitational signal, which we call \"quiet kilonovae.\" Using DES data and the Milky Way's r-process abundance, we constrain quiet kilonovae. Third, the spatial distribution of neutron star merger kilonovae and quiet kilonovae in galaxies can be used to detect dark matter. NS-imploding dark matter destroys most neutron stars at the centers of disc galaxies, so that neutron star merger kilonovae would appear mostly in a donut at large radii. We find that as few as ten neutron star merger kilonova events, located to $\\sim$1 kpc precision could validate or exclude dark matter-induced neutron star implosions at $2 \\sigma$ confidence, exploring dark matter-nucleon cross-sections 4-10 orders of magnitude below current direct detection experimental limits. Similarly, NS-imploding dark matter as the source of fast radio bursts can be tested at $2 \\sigma$ confidence once 20 bursts are located in host galaxies by radio arrays like CHIME and HIRAX.",

        "Abstract": "Spectroscopic ellipsometry is a means to investigate optical and dielectric material responses. Conventional spectroscopic ellipsometry has trade-offs between spectral accuracy, resolution, and measurement time. Polarization modulation has afforded poor performance due to its sensitivity to mechanical vibrational noise, thermal instability, and polarization wavelength dependency. We equip a spectroscopic ellipsometer with dual-optical-comb spectroscopy, viz. dual-optical-comb spectroscopic ellipsometry (DCSE). The DCSE directly and simultaneously obtains amplitude and phase information with ultra-high spectral precision that is beyond the conventional limit. This precision is due to the automatic time-sweeping acquisition of the interferogram using Fourier transform spectroscopy and optical combs with well-defined frequency. Ellipsometric evaluation without polarization modulation also enhances the stability and robustness of the system. In this study, we evaluate the DCSE of birefringent materials and thin films, which showed improved spectral accuracy and a resolution of up to 1.2x10-5 nm across a 5-10 THz spectral bandwidth without any mechanical movement.",

        "Abstract": "Game theory has been widely applied to many areas including economics, biology and social sciences. However, it is still challenging to quantify the global stability and global dynamics of the game theory. We developed a landscape and flux framework to quantify the global stability and global dynamics of the game theory. As an example, we investigated the models of three-strategy games: a special replicator-mutator game, the repeated prison dilemma model. In this model, one stable state, two stable states and limit cycle can emerge under different parameters. The repeated Prisoner's Dilemma system has Hopf bifurcation transitions from one stable state to limit cycle state, and then to another one stable state or two stable states, or vice versa. We explored the global stability of the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma system and the kinetic paths between the basins of attractor. The paths are irreversible due to the non-zero flux. One can explain the game for $Peace$ and $War$.",

        "Authors": "Constantinos Daskalakis,Gautam Kamath,John Wright",
        "Abstract": "Given samples from an unknown distribution $p$ and a description of a distribution $q$, are $p$ and $q$ close or far? This question of \"identity testing\" has received significant attention in the case of testing whether $p$ and $q$ are equal or far in total variation distance. However, in recent work, the following questions have been been critical to solving problems at the frontiers of distribution testing:-Alternative Distances: Can we test whether $p$ and $q$ are far in other distances, say Hellinger?-Tolerance: Can we test when $p$ and $q$ are close, rather than equal? And if so, close in which distances?Motivated by these questions, we characterize the complexity of distribution testing under a variety of distances, including total variation, $\\ell_2$, Hellinger, Kullback-Leibler, and $\\chi^2$. For each pair of distances $d_1$ and $d_2$, we study the complexity of testing if $p$ and $q$ are close in $d_1$ versus far in $d_2$, with a focus on identifying which problems allow strongly sublinear testers (i.e., those with complexity $O(n^{1 - \\gamma})$ for some $\\gamma > 0$ where $n$ is the size of the support of the distributions $p$ and $q$). We provide matching upper and lower bounds for each case. We also study these questions in the case where we only have samples from $q$ (equivalence testing), showing qualitative differences from identity testing in terms of when tolerance can be achieved. Our algorithms fall into the classical paradigm of $\\chi^2$-statistics, but require crucial changes to handle the challenges introduced by each distance we consider. Finally, we survey other recent results in an attempt to serve as a reference for the complexity of various distribution testing problems.",

        "Abstract": "We consider the task of determining a football player's ability for a given event type, for example, scoring a goal. We propose an interpretable Bayesian model which is fit using variational inference methods. We implement a Poisson model to capture occurrences of event types, from which we infer player abilities. Our approach also allows the visualisation of differences between players, for a specific ability, through the marginal posterior variational densities. We then use these inferred player abilities to extend the Bayesian hierarchical model of Baio and Blangiardo (2010) which captures a team's scoring rate (the rate at which they score goals). We apply the resulting scheme to the English Premier League, capturing player abilities over the 2013/2014 season, before using output from the hierarchical model to predict whether over or under 2.5 goals will be scored in a given game in the 2014/2015 season. This validates our model as a way of providing insights into team formation and the individual success of sports teams.",

Specifically, we propose and analyze two approaches to adaptive dictionary regularization for the photometric stereo problem. First, we propose an image preprocessing step that utilizes an adaptive dictionary learning model to remove noise and other non-idealities from the image dataset before estimating the normal vectors. We also propose an alternative model where we directly apply the adaptive dictionary regularization to the normal vectors themselves during estimation. We study the practical performance of both methods through extensive simulations, which demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of both methods in the presence of noise.",

        "Abstract": "Skip connections are increasingly utilized by deep neural networks to improve accuracy and cost-efficiency. In particular, the recent DenseNet is efficient in computation and parameters, and achieves state-of-the-art predictions by directly connecting each feature layer to all previous ones. However, DenseNet's extreme connectivity pattern may hinder its scalability to high depths, and in applications like fully convolutional networks, full DenseNet connections are prohibitively expensive. This work first experimentally shows that one key advantage of skip connections is to have short distances among feature layers during backpropagation. Specifically, using a fixed number of skip connections, the connection patterns with shorter backpropagation distance among layers have more accurate predictions. Following this insight, we propose a connection template, Log-DenseNet, which, in comparison to DenseNet, only slightly increases the backpropagation distances among layers from 1 to ($1 + \\log_2 L$), but uses only $L\\log_2 L$ total connections instead of $O(L^2)$. Hence, Log-DenseNets are easier than DenseNets to implement and to scale. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our design principle by showing better performance than DenseNets on tabula rasa semantic segmentation, and competitive results on visual recognition.",

Due to the high precision of the data, uncertainties in the astrophysical background have become the most limiting factor for indirect dark matter detection. In this work we systematically quantify and -- where possible -- reduce uncertainties in the antiproton background. We constrain the propagation of charged cosmic rays through the combination of antiproton, B/C and positron data. Cross section uncertainties are determined from a wide collection of accelerator data and are -- for the first time ever -- fully taken into account. This allows us to robustly constrain even subdominant dark matter signals through their spectral properties. For a standard NFW dark matter profile we are able to exclude thermal WIMPs with masses up to 570 GeV which annihilate into bottom quarks. While we confirm a reported excess compatible with dark matter of mass around 80 GeV, its local (global) significance only reaches 2.2 sigma (1.1 sigma) in our analysis.",

H5.0 Mediated communication becomes infected with pinging H6.0 If scaling and incentives are the problems, then entropy and affection are the solutions H7.0 \"Paleo everything but violence\" provides sensorimotor nutrition H8.0 Humans evolved to resonate ecstatically H9.0 Symmetric spinal health syndrome H9.5 Helping the irresistible force beat the immovable object",
